<h2>I</h2>
<h3>BROKEN</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;The expected has happened, I see,&#8221; said Macloud,
laying aside the paper he had been reading,
and raising his hand for a servant.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought it was the unexpected that happens,&#8221;
Hungerford drawled, languidly. &#8220;What do you
mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Royster &amp; Axtell have been thrown into bankruptcy.
Liabilities of twenty million, assets problematical.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say!&#8221; ejaculated Hungerford,
sitting up sharply. &#8220;Have they caught any of
our friends?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All who dealt with them, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too bad! Too bad!&mdash;Well, they didn&#8217;t catch
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! you&#8217;re not caught!&#8221; said Macloud.
&#8220;Your father was wise enough to put your estate
into Government threes, with a trustee who had
no power to change the investment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m thankful he did,&#8221; Hungerford
answered. &#8220;It saves me all trouble; I need never
look at the stock report, don&#8217;t you know; Government
bonds are always the same.&mdash;I suppose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
it&#8217;s a reflection on my ability, but that is of small
consequence. I don&#8217;t care what people think, so
long as I have the income and no trouble. If I
had control of my capital, I might have lost all
of it with Royster &amp; Axtell, who knows?&#8221;</p>
<p>Macloud shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t likely,&#8221; he commented, &#8220;you wouldn&#8217;t
have had it to lose.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hungerford&#8217;s momentarily vague look suddenly
became knowing.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean I would have lost it long ago?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;Oh, I say, old man, you&#8217;re a bit hard
on me. I may not have much head for business,
but I&#8217;m not altogether a fool, don&#8217;t you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to know it,&#8221; laughed Macloud, as he
arose and sauntered away.</p>
<p>Hungerford drew out his cigarettes and thoughtfully
lighted one.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder&mdash;did he mean I am or I am not?&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I wonder. I shall have to ask him some
time.&mdash;Boy! a Scotch and soda.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Macloud passed into the Club-house
and, mounting the stairs to the second floor,
knocked sharply at a door in the north-west corner
of the corridor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; called a voice.&mdash;&#8220;Who is it?&mdash;Oh!
it&#8217;s you, Macloud. Make yourself at home&mdash;I&#8217;ll be
out in a moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was the noise of splashing water, accompanied
by sundry exclamations and snorts, followed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
by a period of silence; and, then, from the
bath room, emerged Croyden clad in robe,
slippers and a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Help yourself,&#8221; he said, pointing to the smoking
materials. He filled a pipe, lit it carefully,
blew a few whiffs to the ceiling and watched them
slowly dissipate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s come,&#8221; he remarked: &#8220;Royster &amp;
Axtell have smashed clean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not clean,&#8221; said Macloud. &#8220;It is going to
be the most criminal failure this town has ever
known.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean they have busted wide open&mdash;and I&#8217;m
one of the suckers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are going to have plenty of company,
among your friends,&#8221; Macloud answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so&mdash;but I hope none of them is hit
quite so bad.&#8221; He blew another cloud of smoke
and watched it fade. &#8220;The truth is, Colin, I&#8217;m
done for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed Macloud. &#8220;You don&#8217;t
mean you are cleaned out?&#8221;</p>
<p>The other nodded. &#8220;That&#8217;s about it.... I&#8217;ve
a few thousand left&mdash;enough to pay laundry bills,
and to board on Hash Alley for a few months a
year. Oh! I was a sucker, all right!&mdash;I was so
easy it makes me ashamed to have saved <i>anything</i>
from the wreck. I&#8217;ve a notion to go and offer it
to them, now.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were both bitterness and relief in his tones;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
bitterness over the loss, relief that the worst, at
last, had happened.</p>
<p>For a while, there was silence. Croyden turned
away and began to dress; Macloud sat looking
out on the lawn in front, where a foursome were
playing the home hole, and another waiting until
they got off the green.</p>
<p>Presently, the latter spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did it happen, old man?&#8221; he asked&mdash;&#8220;that
is, if you care to tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden laughed shortly. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t pleasant
to relate how one has been such an addle-pated
ass&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, forgive me.&mdash;I didn&#8217;t mean to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! I understand&mdash;moreover, it will
ease my mortification to confide in one who won&#8217;t
attempt to sympathize. I don&#8217;t care for sympathy,
I don&#8217;t deserve it, and what&#8217;s more, I won&#8217;t have
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let that worry you,&#8221; Macloud answered.
&#8220;You won&#8217;t be oppressed by any rush of sympathy.
No one is who gets pinched in the stock market.
We all go in, and&mdash;sooner or later, generally
sooner&mdash;we all get burnt&mdash;and we all think every
one but ourselves got only what was due him. No,
my boy, there is no sympathy running loose for
the lamb who has been shorn. And you don&#8217;t
need to expect it from your friends of the Heights.
They believe only in success. The moment you&#8217;re
fleeced, they fling you aside. They fatten off the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
carcasses of others&mdash;yours and mine and their own
brothers. Friendship does not enter into the game.
They will eat your bread and salt to-night, and
dance on your financial corpse to-morrow. The
only respect they have is for money, and clothes,
and show; and the more money, and the more
show the greater their deference&mdash;while they last&mdash;and
the farther the fall when they fail. The
women are as bad as the men, in a smaller way.
They will blacken one another&#8217;s reputation with an
ease and zest that is simply appalling, and laugh
in your face while doing it. I&#8217;m speaking generally,
there are exceptions, of course, but they only prove
the rule. Yet, what can you expect, where aristocracy
is based on one&#8217;s bank account, and the
ability to keep the other fellows from laying violent
hands on it. It reminds one of the Robbers of
the Rhine! Steal everything within reach and give
up nothing. Oh! it is a fine system of living!&mdash;Your
pardon! I forgot myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is good to have you forget yourself occasionally,&#8221;
said Croyden&mdash;&#8220;especially, when your
views chime with mine&mdash;recently acquired, I admit.
I began to see it about a month ago, when I slowed
down on expenditures. I thought I could notice
an answering chill in the grill-room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like enough. You must spend to get on.
They have no use for one who doesn&#8217;t. You have
committed the unpardonable sin: had a fortune
and lost it. And they never forgive&mdash;unless you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
make another fortune; then they will welcome you
back, and lay plans to take it, also.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You paint a pretty picture!&#8221; Croyden
laughed.</p>
<p>Macloud shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me of Royster &amp; Axtell,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t a great deal to tell,&#8221; Croyden
replied, coming around from the dressing table,
and drawing on his vest as he came. &#8220;It is five
years since my father died and left me sole heir
to his estate. In round numbers, it aggregated
half a million dollars&mdash;all in stocks and bonds, except
a little place down on the Eastern Shore which
he took, some years before he died, in payment of
a debt due him. Since my mother&#8217;s demise my
father had led the life of quiet and retirement in
a small city. I went through college, was given
a year abroad, took the law course at Harvard,
and settled down to the business of getting a
practice. Then the pater died, suddenly. Five
hundred thousand was a lot of money in that town.
Too much to settle there, I thought. I abandoned
the law, and came to Northumberland. The governor
had been a non-resident member of the
Northumberland Club, which made it easy for me
to join. I soon found, however, that what had
seemed ample wealth in the old town, did not much
more than make ends meet, here&mdash;provided I kept
up my end. I was about the poorest one in the
set I affected, so, naturally, I went into the stock
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
market. Royster was the particular broker of the
gang and the first year I did very well.&mdash;You
think it was intended?&#8221; (As Macloud smiled.)
&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t doubt now you&#8217;re right. The next
year I began to lose. Then Royster put me into
that Company of his down in Virginia&mdash;the Virginia
Improvement Company, you know. He took
me down, in a special car, showed me how much
he himself had in it, how much would be got out
of it, offered to let me in on the ground floor,
and made it look so rosy, withal, that I succumbed.
Two hundred thousand was buried there. An
equal amount I had lent them, at six per cent.,
shortly after I came to Northumberland&mdash;selling
the securities that yielded only four per cent. to
do it. That accounts for four hundred thousand&mdash;gone
up the flume. Eighty thousand I lost in
stocks. The remainder, about twenty thousand, I
still have. By some error I can&#8217;t account for,
they did not get away with it, too.&mdash;Such is the
tale of a foolish man,&#8221; he ended.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you make any effort to have Royster
prosecuted?&#8221; Macloud asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;I&#8217;ve been pretty much of a baby, but I&#8217;m
not going to cry over milk that&#8217;s spilt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not all spilt&mdash;some of it will be recovered.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Macloud, there won&#8217;t be enough
money recovered to buy me cigarettes for one
evening. Royster has hypothecated and rehypothecated
securities until no man can trace his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
own, even if it would help him to do so. You said
it would <i>likely</i> prove a disgraceful failure. I am
absolutely sure of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Macloud beat a tattoo on the window-ledge.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of doing?&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;or
haven&#8217;t you got to it, yet&mdash;or don&#8217;t you care to
tell?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to it,&#8221; replied Croyden; &#8220;and I
don&#8217;t care to tell&mdash;anyone but you, Colin. I can&#8217;t
stay here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not on twelve hundred a year, certainly&mdash;unless
you spend the little principal you have
left, and, then, drop off for good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which would be playing the baby act, sure
enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Macloud nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but, sometimes, men
don&#8217;t look at it that way. They cannot face the
loss of caste. They prefer to drop overboard by
<i>accident</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t going to be any dropping overboard
by accident in mine,&#8221; replied Croyden.
&#8220;What I&#8217;ve decided to do is this: I shall disappear.
I have no debts, thank God! so no one will
care to take the trouble to search for me. I shall
go down to Hampton, to the little property that
was left me on the Eastern Shore, there to mark
time, either until I can endure it, or until I can
pick out some other abode. I&#8217;ve a bunch of expensive
habits to get rid of quickly, and the best
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
place for that, it seems to me, is a small town where
they are impossible, as well as unnecessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever lived in a small town?&#8221; Macloud inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;None smaller than my old home. I suppose
it will be very stupid, after the life here, but beggars
can&#8217;t be choosers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure it will be very stupid,&#8221; said
Macloud. &#8220;It depends on how much you liked
this froth and try, we have here. The want to
and can&#8217;t&mdash;the aping the ways and manners of
those who have had wealth for generations, and
are well-born, beside. Look at them!&#8221; with a
fling of his arm, that embraced the Club-house and
its environs.&mdash;&#8220;One generation old in wealth, one
generation old in family, and about six months
old, some of them scarcely that, in breeding. There
are a few families which belong by right of birth&mdash;and,
thank God! they show it. But they are
shouldered aside by the others, and don&#8217;t make
much of a show. The climbers hate them, but are
too much awed by their lineage to crowd them out,
entirely. A nice lot of aristocrats! The majority
of them are puddlers of the iron mills, and the
peasants of Europe, come over so recently the soil
is still clinging to their clothes. Down on the
Eastern Shore you will find it very different. They
ask one, who you <i>are</i>, never how much money you
have. Their aristocracy is one of birth and culture.
You may be reduced to manual labor for a livelihood,
but you belong just the same. You have had a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
sample of the money-changers and their heartless
methods&mdash;and it has left a bitter taste in your
mouth. I think you will welcome the change. It
will be a new life, and, in a measure, a quiet life,
but there are compensations to one to whom life
holds more than garish living and ostentatious
show.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know the people of the Eastern Shore?&#8221;
asked Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&mdash;but I know the people of the Western
Shore, and they come from the same stock&mdash;and
it&#8217;s good stock, mighty good stock! Moreover, you
are not burying yourself so deep&mdash;Baltimore is
just across the Bay, and Philadelphia and New
York are but a few hours distant&mdash;less distant
than this place is, indeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I looked up the time-tables!&#8221; laughed Croyden.
&#8220;My present knowledge of Hampton is limited to
the means and methods of getting away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And getting to it,&#8221; appended Macloud.
&#8220;When do you go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hum&mdash;rather sudden, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen it coming for a month, so I&#8217;ve had
time to pay my small accounts, arrange my few
affairs, and be prepared to flit on a moment&#8217;s
notice. I should have gone a week ago, but I
indulged myself with a few more days of the old
life. Now, I&#8217;m off to-morrow night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall you go direct to Hampton?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Direct to Hampton, via New York,&#8221; said
Croyden. &#8220;There probably won&#8217;t anyone care
enough even to inquire for me, but I&#8217;m not taking
the chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Macloud watched him with careful scrutiny.
Was it serious or was it assumed? Had this seemingly
sudden resolve only the failure of Royster &amp;
Axtell behind it, or was there a woman there, as
well? Was Elaine Cavendish the real reason?
There could be no doubt of Croyden&#8217;s devotion to
her&mdash;and her more than passing regard for him.
Was it because he could not, or because he would
not&mdash;or both? Croyden was practically penniless&mdash;she
was an only child, rich in her own right,
and more than rich in prospect&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you dine with me, this evening?&#8221; asked
Macloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, old man, but I&#8217;m due at the Cavendishes&#8217;&mdash;just
a pick-up by telephone. I shall see you,
again, shan&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon so,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;I&#8217;m down
here for the night. Have breakfast with me in
the morning&mdash;if I&#8217;m not too early a bird, at eight
o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! for two on the side piazza!&#8221; exclaimed
Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll speak to François,&#8221; said Macloud, arising.
&#8220;So long.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden slowly straightened his tie and drew
on his coat.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Macloud is a square chap,&#8221; he reflected. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
had a lot of so-called friends, here, but he is the
only one who still rings true. I may imagine it,
but I&#8217;m sure the rest are beginning to shy off.
Well, I shan&#8217;t bother them much longer&mdash;they can
prepare for a new victim.&#8221;</p>
<p>He picked up his hat and went downstairs,
making his way out by the front entrance, so as
to miss the crowd in the grill-room. He did not
want the trouble of speaking or of being spoken to.
He saw Macloud, as he passed&mdash;out on the piazza
beyond the porte-cochere, and he waved his hand
to him. Then he signalled the car, that had been
sent from Cavencliffe for him, and drove off to
the Cavendishes.</p>
<hr class='major' />
<div style='margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em'>
<a name='II_GOODBYE' id='II_GOODBYE'></a>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
<h2>II</h2>
<h3>GOOD-BYE</h3>
</div>

<p>The Cavendishes were of those who (to quote
Macloud&#8217;s words) &#8220;did belong and, thank God,
showed it.&#8221; Henry Cavendish had married
Josephine Marquand in the days before there were
any idle-rich in Northumberland, and when the only
leisure class were in jail. Now, when the idea, that
it was respectable not to work, was in the ascendency,
he still went to his office with unfailing
regularity&mdash;and the fact that the Tuscarora Trust
Company paid sixty per cent. on its capital stock,
and sold in the market (when you could get it) at
three thousand dollars a share, was due to his ability
and shrewd financiering as president. It was because
he refused to give up the active management
even temporarily, that they had built their summer
home on the Heights, where there was plenty of
pure air, unmixed with the smoke of the mills and
trains, and with the Club near enough to give them
its life and gayety when they wished.</p>
<p>The original Cavendish and the original Marquand
had come to Northumberland, as officers,
with Colonel Harmer and his detachment of
Regulars, at the close of the Revolution, had seen
the possibilities of the place, and, after a time,
had resigned and settled down to business. Having
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
brought means with them from Philadelphia, they
quickly accumulated more, buying up vast tracts
of Depreciation lands and numerous In-lots and
Out-lots in the original plan of the town. These
had never been sold, and hence it was, that, by the
natural rise in value from a straggling forest to
a great and thriving city, the Cavendish and the
Marquand estates were enormously valuable. And
hence, also, the fact that Elaine Cavendish&#8217;s grandparents,
on both sides of the house, were able
to leave her a goodly fortune, absolutely, and yet
not disturb the natural descent of the bulk of their
possessions.</p>
<p>Having had wealth for generations, the
Cavendishes were as natural and unaffected in their
use of it, as the majority of their neighbors were
tawdry and flashy. They did things because they
wanted to do them, not because someone else did
them. And they did not do things that others
did, and never thought what the others might
think.</p>
<p>Because an iron-magnate, with only dollars for
ballast, had fifteen bath pools of Sienna marble in
his flaunting, gaudy &#8220;chateau,&#8221; and was immediately
aped by the rest of the rattle-brained,
moved the Cavendishes not at all. Because the same
bounder gave a bathing-suit party (with the ocean
one hundred and fifty miles away), at which prizes
were bestowed on the man and woman who dared
wear the least clothes, while the others of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
<i>nouveaux riches</i> applauded and marvelled at his
audacity and originality, simply made the Cavendishes
stay away. Because another mushroom
millionaire bought books for his library by the
foot, had gold mangers and silver stalls for his
horses, and adorned himself with diamonds like
an Indian Rajah, were no incentives to the
Cavendishes to do likewise. They pursued the even
tenor of the well-bred way.</p>
<p>Cavencliffe was a great, roomy country-house,
in the Colonial style, furnished in chintz and
cretonnes, light and airy, with wicker furniture and
bird&#8217;s-eye maple throughout, save in the dining-room,
where there was the slenderest of old Hepplewhite.
Wide piazzas flanked the house on every
side, screened and awninged from the sun and wind
and rain. A winding driveway between privet
hedges, led up from the main road half a mile
away, through a maze of giant forest trees amid
which the place was set.</p>
<p>Croyden watched it, thoughtfully, as the car
spun up the avenue. He saw the group on the
piazza, the waiting man-servant, the fling upward
of a hand in greeting by a white robed figure.
And he sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;My last welcome to Cavencliffe!&#8221; he muttered.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a bully place, and a bully girl&mdash;and, I think,
I had a chance, if I hadn&#8217;t been such a fool.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elaine Cavendish came forward a little way to
greet him. And Croyden sighed, again, as&mdash;with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
the grace he had learned as a child from his South
Carolina mother, he bent for an instant over her
hand. He had never known how handsome she was,
until this visit&mdash;and he had come to say good-bye!</p>
<p>&#8220;You were good to come,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was good of you to ask me,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>The words were trite, but there was a note of
intenseness in his tones that made her look sharply
at him&mdash;then, away, as a trace of color came
faintly to her cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know the others,&#8221; she said, perfunctorily.</p>
<p>And Croyden smiled in answer, and greeted the
rest of the guests.</p>
<p>There were but six of them: Mrs. Chichester,
a young matron, of less than thirty, whose husband
was down in Panama explaining some contract to
the Government Engineers; Nancy Wellesly, a
rather petite blonde, who was beginning to care
for her complexion and other people&#8217;s reputations,
but was a square girl, just the same; and Charlotte
Brundage, a pink and white beauty, but the crack
tennis and golf player of her sex at the Club and a
thorough good sport, besides.</p>
<p>The men were: Harold Hungerford, who was
harmlessly negative and inoffensively polite;
Roderick Colloden, who, after Macloud, was the
most popular man in the set, a tall, red haired chap,
who always seemed genuinely glad to meet anyone
in any place, and whose handshake gave emphasis
to it. He had not a particularly good memory
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
for faces, and the story is still current in the Club
of how, when he had been presented to a newcomer
four times in one week, and had always told him how
glad he was to meet him, the man lost patience
and blurted out, that he was damn glad to know
it, but, if Colloden would recognize him the next
time they met, he would be more apt to believe it.
The remaining member of the party was Montecute
Mattison. He was a small man, with peevishly
pinched features, that wore an incipient smirk when
in repose, and a hyena snarl when in action. He
had no friends and no intimates. He was the sort
who played dirty golf in a match: deliberately
moving on the green, casting his shadow across the
hole, talking when his opponent was about to drive,
and anything else to disconcert. In fact, he was
a dirty player in any game&mdash;because it was natural.
He would not have been tolerated a moment, even
at the Heights, if he had not been Warwick Mattison&#8217;s
son, and the heir to his millions. He never
made an honest dollar in his life, and could not, if
he tried, but he was Assistant-Treasurer of his
father&#8217;s company, did an hour&#8217;s work every day
signing the checks, and drew fifteen thousand a
year for it. A man&#8217;s constant inclination was to
smash him in the face&mdash;and the only reason he
escaped was because it would have been like beating
a child. One man had, when Mattison was
more than ordinarily offensive, laid him across his
knee, and, in full sight of the Club-house, administered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
a good old-fashioned spanking with a golf
club. Him Montecute thereafter let alone. The
others did not take the trouble, however. They
simply shrugged their shoulders, and swore at him
freely and to his face.</p>
<p>At present, he was playing the devoted to Miss
Brundage and hence his inclusion in the party. She
cared nothing for him, but his money was a thing
to be considered&mdash;having very little of her own&mdash;and
she was doing her best to overcome her repugnance
sufficiently to place him among the
eligibles.</p>
<p>Mattison got through the dinner without any
exhibition of ill nature, but, when the women retired,
it came promptly to the fore.</p>
<p>The talk had turned on the subject of the Club
Horse Show. It was scheduled for the following
month, and was quite the event of the Autumn,
in both a social and an equine sense. The women
showed their gowns and hosiery, the men their horses
and equipment, and how appropriately they could
rig themselves out&mdash;while the general herd stood
around the ring gaping and envious.</p>
<p>Presently, there came a momentary lull in the
conversation and Mattison remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;I see Royster &amp; Axtell went up to-day. I
reckon,&#8221; with an insinuating laugh, &#8220;there will be
some entries withdrawn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Men or horses?&#8221; asked Hungerford.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Both&mdash;and men who haven&#8217;t horses, as well,&#8221;
with a sneering glance at Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, bless me! he&#8217;s looking at you, Geoffrey!&#8221;
Hungerford exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not responsible for the direction of Mr.
Mattison&#8217;s eyes,&#8221; Croyden answered with assumed
good nature.</p>
<p>Mattison smiled, maliciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it so bad as that?&#8221; he queried. &#8220;I knew,
of course, you were hit, but I hoped it was only
for a small amount.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up, Mattison!&#8221; exclaimed Colloden. &#8220;If
you haven&#8217;t any appreciation of propriety, you
can at least keep quiet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you?&#8221; said Colloden, quietly, reaching
across and grasping him by the collar. &#8220;Think
again,&mdash;<i>and think quickly</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>A sickly grin, half of surprise and half of
anger, overspread Mattison&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you take a little pleasantry?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t like your pleasantries any more
than we like you, and that is not at all. Take
my advice and mend your tongue.&#8221; He shook him,
much as a terrier does a rat, and jammed him back
into his chair. &#8220;Now, either be good or go home,&#8221;
he admonished.</p>
<p>Mattison was weak with anger&mdash;so angry, indeed,
that he was helpless either to stir or to make
a sound. The others ignored him&mdash;and, when he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
was a little recovered, he got up and went slowly
from the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t a particularly well bred thing to do,&#8221;
observed Colloden, &#8220;but just the same it was
mighty pleasant. If it were not for the law, I&#8217;d
have broken his neck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t worth the exertion, Roderick,&#8221;
Croyden remarked. &#8220;But I&#8217;m obliged, old man.
I enjoyed it.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they rejoined the ladies on the piazza, a
little later, Mattison had gone.</p>
<p>After a while, the others went off in their
motors, leaving Croyden alone with Miss Cavendish.
Hungerford had offered to drop him at the Club,
but he had declined. He would enjoy himself a
little longer&mdash;would give himself the satisfaction
of another hour with her, before he passed into
outer darkness.</p>
<p>He had gone along in his easy, bachelor way,
without a serious thought for any woman, until
six months ago. Then, Elaine Cavendish came
home, after three years spent in out-of-the-way
corners of the globe, and, straightway, bound him
to her chariot wheels.</p>
<p>At least, so the women said&mdash;who make it their
particular business to observe&mdash;and they never
make mistakes. They can tell when one is preparing
to fall in love, long before he knows himself.
Indeed, there have been many men drawn into
matrimony, against their own express inclination,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
merely by the accumulation of initiative engendered
by impertinent meddlers. They want none of it,
they even fight desperately against it, but, in the
end, they succumb.</p>
<p>And Geoffrey Croyden would have eventually
succumbed, of his own desires, however, had Elaine
Cavendish been less wealthy, and had his affairs
been more at ease. Now, he thanked high Heaven
he had not offered himself. She might have accepted
him; and think of all the heart-burnings
and pain that would now ensue, before he went
out of her life!</p>
<p>&#8220;What were you men doing to Montecute Mattison?&#8221;
she asked presently. &#8220;He appeared perfectly
furious when he came out, and he went
off without a word to anyone&mdash;even Charlotte
Brundage was ignored.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He and Colloden had a little difficulty&mdash;and
Mattison left us,&#8221; Croyden answered. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t he
stop to say good-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head. &#8220;He called something as
he drove off&mdash;but I think he was swearing at his
man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He needed something to swear at, I fancy!&#8221;
Croyden laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did Roderick do?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Took him by the collar and shook him&mdash;and
told him either to go home or be quiet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And he went home&mdash;I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;when he had recovered himself sufficiently.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
I thought, at first, his anger was going
to choke him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Imagine big, good-natured Roderick stirred
sufficiently to lay hands on any one!&#8221; she laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;But imagine him <i>when</i> stirred,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t thought of him in that way,&#8221; she said,
slowly&mdash;&#8220;Ough!&#8221; with a little shiver, &#8220;it must
have been terrifying&mdash;what had Mattison done to
him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing&mdash;Mattison is too much of a coward
ever to <i>do</i> anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What had he said, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, some brutality about one of Colloden&#8217;s
friends, I think,&#8221; Croyden evaded. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t quite
hear it&mdash;and we didn&#8217;t discuss it afterward.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m told he is a scurrilous little beast, with
the men,&#8221; she commented; &#8220;but, I must say, he is
always polite to me, and reasonably charitable.
Indeed, to-night is the only deliberately bad manners
he has ever exhibited.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He knows the men won&#8217;t hurt him,&#8221; said
Croyden, &#8220;whereas the women, if he showed his
ill nature to them, would promptly ostracize him.
He is a canny bounder, all right.&#8221; He made a
gesture of repugnance. &#8220;We have had enough
of Mattison&mdash;let us find something more interesting&mdash;yourself,
for instance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or yourself!&#8221; she smiled. &#8220;Or, better still,
neither. Which reminds me&mdash;Miss Southard is
coming to-morrow; you will be over, of course?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going East to-morrow night,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But she is to stay two weeks&mdash;you will be
back before she leaves, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear not&mdash;I may go on to London.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Before you return here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;before I return here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this London idea rather sudden?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been anticipating it for some time,&#8221; sending
a cloud of cigarette smoke before his face.
&#8220;But it grew imminent only to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the smoke faded, her eyes were looking
questioningly into his. There was something in
his words that did not ring quite true. It was too
sudden to be genuine, too unexpected. It struck
her as vague and insincere. Yet there was no occasion
to mistrust&mdash;it was common enough for men
to be called suddenly to England on business.&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;When do you expect to return?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; he said, reading something
that was in her mind. &#8220;If I must go, the business
which takes me will also fix my return.&#8221;</p>
<p>A servant approached.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Hudson?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;The telephone, Miss Cavendish. Pride&#8217;s
Crossing wishes to talk with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden arose&mdash;it was better to make the farewell
brief&mdash;and accompanied her to the doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; he said, simply.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You must go?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;there are some things that must be done
to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gave him another look.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye, then&mdash;and <i>bon voyage</i>,&#8221; she said, extending
her hand.</p>
<p>He took it&mdash;hesitated just an instant&mdash;lifted it
to his lips&mdash;and, then, without a word, swung
around and went out into the night.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The next day&mdash;at noon&mdash;when, her breakfast
finished, she came down stairs, a scare headline
in the morning&#8217;s paper, lying in the hall, met
her eyes.</p>

<p>She seized the paper, and nervously ran her
eyes down the columns until they reached the list
of those involved.&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Yes! Croyden&#8217;s name was among them! That
was what had taken him away!</p>
<p>And Croyden read it, too, as he sped Eastward
toward the unknown life.</p>

<h2>III</h2>
<h3>CLARENDON</h3>
</div>

<p>Croyden left Northumberland in the morning&mdash;and
his economy began with the ride East: he
went on Day Express instead of on the Limited,
thereby saving the extra fare. At Philadelphia he
sent his baggage to the Bellevue-Stratford; later
in the evening, he had it returned to the station,
and checked it, himself, to Hampton&mdash;to avoid the
possibility of being followed by means of his
luggage.</p>
<p>He did not imagine that any one would go to
the trouble to trace him, but he was not taking
any chances. He wanted to cut himself away,
utterly, from his former life, to be free of everyone
he had ever known. It was not likely he
would be missed.</p>
<p>Some one would say: &#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen Croyden
lately,&#8221; would be answered: &#8220;I think he went
abroad suddenly&mdash;about the time of the Royster
&amp; Axtell failure,&#8221; and, with that, he would pass
out of notice. If he were to return, any time
within the next five years, he would be met by a
languid: &#8220;Been away, somewhere, haven&#8217;t you?
I thought I hadn&#8217;t noticed you around the Club,
lately.&#8221;&mdash;And that would be the extent of it.</p>
<p>One is not missed in a big town. His going
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
and his coming are not watched. There is no time
to bother with another&#8217;s affairs. Everyone has
enough to do to look after his own. The curiosity
about one&#8217;s neighbors&mdash;what he wears, what he
eats, what he does, every item in his daily life&mdash;that
is developed by idleness, thrives in littleness,
and grows to perfection in scandal and innuendo&mdash;belongs
solely to the small town. If one comes
down street with a grip&mdash;instantly: So and so
is &#8220;going away&#8221;&mdash;speculation as to why?&mdash;where?&mdash;what?
One puts on a new suit, it is observed
and noted.&mdash;A pair of new shoes, ditto.&mdash;A new
necktie, ditto. Every particular of his life is
public property, is inspected for a motive, and, if
a motive cannot be discovered, one is supplied&mdash;usually
mean and little, the latter unctuously preferred.</p>
<p>All this Croyden was yet to learn, however.</p>
<p>He took the night&#8217;s express on the N. Y., P. &amp;
N., whence, at Hampton Junction, he transferred
to a branch line. For twenty miles the train
seemed to crawl along, burrowing into the sand
hills and out again into sand, and in and out again,
until, at length, with much whistling and escaping
steam, they wheezed into the station and stopped.</p>
<p>There were a dozen white men, with slouch hats
and nondescript clothing, standing aimlessly
around, a few score of negroes, and a couple of
antique carriages with horses to match. The white
men looked at the new arrival, listlessly, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
negroes with no interest at all&mdash;save the two who
were porters for the rival hotels. They both made
for Croyden and endeavored to take his grip.</p>
<p>He waved them away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want your hotel, boys,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But
if you can tell me where Clarendon is, I will be
obliged.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cla&#8217;endon! seh? yass, seh,&#8221; said one, &#8220;right
out at de een&#8217; o&#8217; de village, seh&mdash;dis street tek&#8217;s
yo dyar, seh, sho nuf.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which end of the village?&#8221; Croyden asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dis een&#8217;, seh, de fust house beyon&#8217; Majah
Bo&#8217;den&#8217;s, seh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How many blocks is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blocks, seh!&#8221; said the negro. &#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t no
blocks&mdash;it&#8217;s jest de fust place beyon&#8217; Majah
Bo&#8217;den&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden laughed. &#8220;Here,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you take
my bag out to Clarendon&mdash;I&#8217;ll walk till I find it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yass, seh! yass, seh! I&#8217;ll do it, seh! but yo
bettah ride, seh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; said Croyden, looking at the vehicle.
&#8220;It&#8217;s safer to walk.&#8221;</p>
<p>He tossed the negro a quarter and turned away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thankee, seh, thankee, seh, I&#8217;ll brings it right
out, seh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden went slowly down the street, while the
crowd stared after him, and the shops emptied
their loafers to join them in the staring. He was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
a strange man&mdash;and a well-dressed man&mdash;and they
all were curious.</p>
<p>Presently, the shops were replaced by dwellings
of the humbler sort, then they, in turn, by more
pretentious residences&mdash;with here and there a new
one of the Queen Anne type. Croyden did not
need the information, later vouchsafed, that they
belong to <i>new</i> people. It was as unmistakable as
the houses themselves.</p>
<p>About a mile from the station, he passed a
place built of English brick, covered on the sides
by vines, and shaded by huge trees. It stood well
back from the street and had about it an air of
aristocracy and exclusiveness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if this is the Bordens&#8217;?&#8221; said Croyden
looking about him for some one to ask&mdash;&#8220;Ah!&#8221;</p>
<p>Down the path from the house was coming a
young woman. He slowed down, so as to allow
her to reach the entrance gates ahead of him. She
was pretty, he saw, as she neared&mdash;very pretty!&mdash;positively
beautiful! dark hair and&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>He took off his hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Is this Mr.
Borden&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;this is Major Borden&#8217;s,&#8221; she answered,
with a deliciously soft intonation, which instantly
stirred Croyden&#8217;s Southern blood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Clarendon is the next place, is it not?&#8221;</p>
<p>She gave him the quickest glance of interest, as
she replied in the affirmative.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel Duval is dead, however,&#8221; she added&mdash;&#8220;a
caretaker is the only person there, now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I understood.&#8221; There was no excuse for
detaining her longer. &#8220;Thank you, very much!&#8221;
he ended, bowed slightly, and went on.</p>
<p>It is ill bred and rude to stare back at a woman,
but, if ever Croyden had been tempted, it was
now. He heard her footsteps growing fainter in
the distance, as he continued slowly on his way.
Something behind him seemed to twitch at his
head, and his neck was positively stiff with the
exertion necessary to keep it straight to the fore.</p>
<p>He wanted another look at that charming figure,
with the mass of blue black hair above it, and the
slender silken ankles and slim tan-shod feet below.
He remembered that her eyes were blue, and that
they met him through long lashes, in a languidly
alluring glance; that she was fair; and that her
mouth was generous, with lips full but delicate&mdash;a
face, withal, that clung in his memory, and that
he proposed to see again&mdash;and soon.</p>
<p>He walked on, so intent on his visual image,
he did not notice that the Borden place was behind
him now, and he was passing the avenue that
led into Clarendon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yass, seh! hyar yo is, marster!&mdash;hyar&#8217;s
Clarendon,&#8221; called the negro, hastening up behind
him with his bag.</p>
<p>Croyden turned into the walk&mdash;the black followed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Cun&#8217;l Duval&#8217;s done been daid dis many a day,
seh,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Folks sez ez how it&#8217;s owned by
some city fellah, now. Mebbe yo knows &#8217;im, seh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden did not answer, he was looking at the
place&mdash;and the negro, with an inquisitively curious
eye, relapsed into silence.</p>
<p>The house was very similar to the Bordens&#8217;&mdash;unpretentious,
except for the respectability that goes
with apparent age, vine clad and tree shaded. It
was of generous proportions, without being large&mdash;with
a central hall, and rooms on either side, that
rose to two stories, and was topped by a pitch-roof.
There were no piazzas at front or side, just
a small stoop at the doorway, from which paths
branched around to the rear.</p>
<p>&#8220;I done &#8217;speck, seh, yo go roun&#8217; to de back,&#8221;
said the negro, as Croyden put his foot on the
step. &#8220;Ole Mose &#8217;im live dyar. I&#8217;ll bring &#8217;im heah,
ef yo wait, seh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is old Mose&mdash;the caretaker?&#8221; said
Croyden.</p>
<p>The place was looked after by a real estate
man of the village, and neither his father nor he
had bothered to do more than meet the accounts
for funds. The former had preferred to let it
remain unoccupied, so as to have it ready for instant
use, if he so wished, and Croyden had done
the same.</p>
<p>&#8220;He! Mose he&#8217;s Cun&#8217;l Duval&#8217;s body-survent,
seh. Him an&#8217; Jos&#8217;phine&mdash;Jos&#8217;phine he wif&#8217;, seh&mdash;dey
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
looks arfter de place sence de ole Cun&#8217;l died.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden nodded. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go back.&#8221;</p>
<p>They followed the right hand path, which seemed
to be more used than its fellow. The servants&#8217;
quarters were disclosed at the far end of the lot.</p>
<p>Before the tidiest of them, an old negro was
sitting on a stool, dreaming in the sun. At
Croyden&#8217;s appearance, he got up hastily, and came
forward&mdash;gray-haired, and bent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Survent, seh!&#8221; he said, with the remains of
what once must have been a wonderfully graceful
bow, and taking in the stranger&#8217;s attire with a
single glance. &#8220;I&#8217;se ole Mose. Cun&#8217;l Duval&#8217;s boy&mdash;seh,
an&#8217; I looks arfter de place, now. De Cun&#8217;l
he&#8217;s daid, yo knows, seh. What can I do fur yo,
seh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Mr. Croyden,&#8221; said Geoffrey.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yass, seh! yass, seh!&#8221; the darky answered, inquiringly.</p>
<p>It was evident the name conveyed no meaning
to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the new owner, you know&mdash;since Colonel
Duval died,&#8221; Croyden explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi! yo is!&#8221; old Mose exclaimed, with another
bow. &#8220;Well, praise de Lawd! I sees yo befo&#8217; I
dies. So yo&#8217;s de new marster, is yo? I&#8217;m pow&#8217;ful
glad yo&#8217;s come, seh! pow&#8217;ful glad. What mout yo
name be, seh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Croyden!&#8221; replied Geoffrey. &#8220;Now, Moses,
will you open the house and let me in?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yo seen Marster Dick?&#8221; asked the darky.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean the agent? No! Why do you
ask?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Coz why, seh&mdash;I&#8217;m beggin&#8217; yo pa&#8217;den, seh,
but Marster Dick sez, sez he, &#8216;Don&#8217; nuvver lets no
buddy in de house, widout a writin&#8217; from me.&#8217; I
ain&#8217; doubtin&#8217; yo, seh, &#8217;deed I ain&#8217;, but I ruther hed
de writin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re perfectly right,&#8221; Croyden answered.
&#8220;Here, boy!&mdash;do you know Mr. Dick? Well, go
down and tell him that Mr. Croyden is at Clarendon,
and ask him to come out at once. Or, stay,
I&#8217;ll give you a note to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took a card from his pocketbook, wrote
a few lines on it, and gave it to the negro.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yass, seh! Yass, seh!&#8221; said the porter, and,
dropping the grip where he stood, he vanished.</p>
<p>Old Mose dusted the stool with his sleeve, and
proffered it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Set down, seh!&#8221; with another bow. &#8220;Josh
won&#8217; be long.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll lie here,&#8221; he answered, stretching himself
out on the grass. &#8220;You were Colonel Duval&#8217;s
body-servant, you say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yass, seh! from de time I wuz so &#8217;igh. I don&#8217;
&#8217;member when I warn&#8217; he body-survent. I follows
&#8217;im all th&#8217;oo de war, seh, an&#8217; I wus wid &#8217;im when
he died.&#8221; Tears were in the darky&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;Hit&#8217;s
purty nigh time ole Mose gwine too.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And when he died, you stayed and looked after
the old place. That was the right thing to do,&#8221;
said Croyden. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t Colonel Duval have any
children?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, seh. De Cun&#8217;l nuvver married, cuz Miss
Penelope&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He caught himself. &#8220;I toles yo &#8217;bout hit some
time, seh, mebbe!&#8221; he ended cautiously&mdash;talking
about family matters with strangers was not to
be considered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to hear some time,&#8221; said Croyden,
not seeming to notice the darky&#8217;s reticence.
&#8220;When did the Colonel die?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eight years ago cum corn plantin&#8217; time, seh.
He jes&#8217; wen&#8217; right off quick like, when de mis&#8217;ry hit
&#8217;im in de chist&mdash;numonya, de doctors call&#8217;d it.
De Cun&#8217;l guv de place to a No&#8217;thern gent&#8217;man,

an&#8217; look arfter hit. He nuvver been heah. Hi!
listen to dis nigger! yo&#8217;s de gent&#8217;mans, mebbe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am his son,&#8221; said Croyden, amused.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; yo owns Cla&#8217;endon, now, seh? What yo
goin&#8217; to do wid it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to live here. Don&#8217;t you want to look
after me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Goin&#8217; to live heah!&mdash;yo means it, seh?&#8221; the
darky asked, in great amazement.</p>
<p>Croyden nodded. &#8220;Provided you will stay with
me&mdash;and if you can find me a cook. Who cooks
your meals?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Lawd, seh! find yo a cook. Didn&#8217; Jos&#8217;phine
cook fur de Cun&#8217;l all he life&mdash;Jos&#8217;phine, she my
wife, seh&mdash;she jest gone nex&#8217; do&#8217;, &#8217;bout some&#8217;n.&#8221;
He got up&mdash;&#8220;I calls her, seh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden stopped him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; he said; &#8220;she will be back, presently,
and there is ample time. Any one live in
these other cabins?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, seh! we&#8217;s all wha&#8217; left. De udder niggers
done gone &#8217;way, sence de Cun&#8217;l died, coz deah war
nothin&#8217; fur dem to do no mo&#8217;, an&#8217; no buddy to
pays dem.&mdash;Dyar is Jos&#8217;phine, now, sir, she be
hear torectly. An&#8217; heah comes Marster Dick,
hisself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden arose and went toward the front of
the house to meet him.</p>
<p>The agent was an elderly man; he wore a black
broadcloth suit, shiny at the elbows and shoulder
blades, a stiff white shirt, a wide roomy collar,
bound around by a black string tie, and a broad-brimmed
drab-felt hat. His greeting was as to
one he had known all his life.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do, Mr. Croyden!&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;I&#8217;m delighted to make your acquaintance, sir.&#8221;
He drew out a key and opened the front door.
&#8220;Welcome to Clarendon, sir, welcome! Let us
hope you will like it enough to spend a little time
here, occasionally.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I too hope so,&#8221; returned Croyden;
&#8220;for I am thinking of making it my home.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Good! Good! It&#8217;s an ideal place!&#8221; exclaimed
the agent. &#8220;It&#8217;s convenient to Baltimore;
and Philadelphia, and New York, and Washington
aren&#8217;t very far away. Exactly what the city people
who can afford it, are doing now,&mdash;making their
homes in the country. Hampton&#8217;s a town, but it&#8217;s
country to you, sir, when compared to Northumberland&mdash;open
the shutters, Mose, so we can see.... This
is the library, with the dining-room behind
it, sir&mdash;and on the other side of the hall is the
drawing-room. Open it, Mose, we will be over
there presently. You see, sir, it is just as Colonel
Duval left it. Your father gave instructions that
nothing should be changed. He was a great friend
of the Colonel, was he not, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe he was,&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;They met
at the White Sulphur, where both spent their summers&mdash;many
years before the Colonel died.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There, hangs the Colonel&#8217;s sword&mdash;he carried
it through the war, sir&mdash;and his pistols&mdash;and his
silk-sash, and here, in the corner, is one of his
regimental guidons&mdash;and here his portrait in uniform&mdash;handsome
man, wasn&#8217;t he? And as gallant
and good as he was handsome. Maryland lost a
brave son, when he died, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He looks the soldier,&#8221; Croyden remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;And he was one, sir&mdash;none better rode behind
Jeb Stuart&mdash;and never far behind, sir, never far
behind!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was in the cavalry?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. Seventh Maryland Cavalry&mdash;he commanded
it during the last two years of the war&mdash;went
in a lieutenant and came out its colonel. A
fine record, sir, a fine record! Pity it is, he had
none to leave it to!&mdash;he was the last of his line,
you know, the last of the line&mdash;not even a distant
cousin to inherit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden looked up at the tall, slender man in
Confederate gray, with clean-cut aristocratic features,
wavy hair, and long, drooping mustache.
What a figure he must have been at the head of
his command, or leading a charge across the level,
while the guns of the Federals belched smoke, and
flame and leaden death.</p>
<p>&#8220;They offered him a brigade,&#8221; the agent was
saying, &#8220;but he declined it, preferring to remain
with his regiment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he do when the war was over?&#8221;
Croyden asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Came home, sir, and resumed his law practice.
Like his great leader, he accepted the decision as
final. He didn&#8217;t spend the balance of his life living
in the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And why did he never marry? Surely, such a
man&#8221; (with a wave of his hand toward the portrait)
&#8220;could have picked almost where he chose!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No one ever just knew, sir&mdash;it had to do with
Miss Borden,&mdash;the sister of Major Borden, sir,
who lives on the next place. They were sweethearts
once, but something or somebody came between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
them&mdash;and thereafter, the Colonel never
seemed to think of love. Perhaps, old Mose knows
it, and if he comes to like you, sir, he may tell you
the story. You understand, sir, that Colonel Duval
is Mose&#8217;s old master, and that every one stands
or falls, in his opinion, according as they measure
up to him. I hope you intend to keep him, sir&mdash;he
has been a faithful caretaker, and there is still
good service in him&mdash;and his wife was the Colonel&#8217;s
cook, so she must have been competent. She would
never cook for anyone, after he died. She thought
she belonged to Clarendon, sort of went with the
place, you understand. Just stayed and helped
Mose take care of it. She doubtless will resume
charge of the kitchen again, without a word. It&#8217;s
the way of the old negroes, sir. The young ones
are pretty worthless&mdash;they&#8217;ve got impudent, and
independent and won&#8217;t work, except when they&#8217;re
out of money. Excuse me, I ramble on&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m much interested,&#8221; said Croyden; &#8220;as I
expect to live here, I must learn the ways of the
people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, let Mose boss the niggers for you, at
first; he understands them, he&#8217;ll make them stand
around. Come over to the drawing-room, sir, I
want you to see the furniture, and the family portraits.... There,
sir, is a set of twelve
genuine Hepplewhite chairs&mdash;no doubt about it, for
the invoice is among the Colonel&#8217;s papers. I don&#8217;t
know much about such things, but a man was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
through here, about a year ago, and, would you
believe it, when he saw the original invoice and
looked at the chairs, he offered me two thousand
dollars for them. Of course, as I had been directed
by your father to keep everything as the Colonel
had it, I just laughed at him. You see, sir, they
have the three feathers, and are beautifully carved,
otherwise. And, here, is a lowboy, with the shell
and the fluted columns, and the cabriole legs,
carved on the knees, and the claw and ball feet.
He offered two hundred dollars for it. And this
sofa, with the lion&#8217;s claw and the eagle&#8217;s wing, he
wanted to buy it, too. In fact, sir, he wanted
to buy about everything in the house&mdash;including
the portraits. There are two by Peale and one by
Stuart&mdash;here are the Peales, sir&mdash;the lady in white,
and the young officer in Continental uniform; and
this is the Stuart&mdash;the gentleman in knee breeches
and velvet coat. I think he is the same as the
one in uniform, only later in life. They are the
Colonel&#8217;s grandparents, sir: Major Daniel Duval,
of the Tenth Maryland Line, and his wife; she
was a Miss Paca&mdash;you know the family, of course,
sir. The Major&#8217;s commission, sir, hangs in the hall,
between the Colonel&#8217;s own and his father&#8217;s&mdash;he
was an officer in the Mexican war, sir. It was a
fighting family, sir, a fighting family&mdash;and a
gentle one as well. &#8216;The bravest are the tenderest,
the loving are the daring.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>There was enough of the South Carolinian of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
the Lowlands in Croyden, to appreciate the Past
and to honor it. He might not know much concerning
Hepplewhite nor the beauty of his lines
and carving, and he might be wofully ignorant
of his own ancestors, having been bred in a State
far removed from their nativity, for he had never
given a thought to the old things, whether of
furniture or of forebears&mdash;they were of the inanimate;
his world had to do only with the living
and what was incidental to it. The Eternal Now
was the Fetich and the God of Northumberland,
all it knew and all it lived for&mdash;and he, with every
one else, had worshipped at its shrine.</p>
<p>It was different here, it seemed! and the spirit
of his long dead mother, with her heritage of
aristocratic lineage, called to him, stirring him
strangely, and his appreciation, that was sleeping
and not dead, came slowly back to life. The men
in buff-and-blue, in small-clothes, in gray, the old
commissions, the savour of the past that clung
around them, were working their due. For no man
of culture and refinement&mdash;nay, indeed, if he have
but their veneer&mdash;can stand in the presence of an
honorable past, of ancestors distinguished and respected,
whether they be his or another&#8217;s, and
be unmoved.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you say there are none to inherit all
these things?&#8221; Croyden exclaimed. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t the
original Duval leave children?&#8221;</p>
<p>The agent shook his head. &#8220;There was but one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
son to each generation, sir&mdash;and with the Colonel
there was none.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, having succeeded to them by right of
purchase, and with no better right outstanding, it
falls to me to see that they are not shamed by
the new owner. Their portraits shall remain undisturbed
either by collectors or by myself. Moreover,
I&#8217;ll look up my own ancestors. I&#8217;ve got some,
down in South Carolina and up in Massachusetts,
and if their portraits be in existence, I&#8217;ll add reproductions
to keep the Duvals company. Ancestors
by inheritance and ancestors by purchase.
The two of them ought to keep me straight, don&#8217;t
you think?&#8221; he said, with a smile.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>
<h3>PARMENTER&#8217;S BEQUEST</h3>
</div>

<p>Croyden, with Dick as guide and old Mose as
forerunner and shutter-opener, went through the
house, even unto the garret.</p>
<p>As in the downstairs, he found it immaculate.
Josephine had kept everything as though the
Colonel himself were in presence. The bed linen,
the coverlids, the quilts, the blankets were packed
in trunks, the table-linen and china in drawers and
closets. None of them was new&mdash;practically the
entire furnishing antedated 1830, and much of
them 1800&mdash;except that, here and there, a few old
rugs of oriental weaves, relieved the bareness of
the hardwood floors.</p>
<p>The one concession to modernism was a bath-room,
but its tin tub and painted iron wash-stand,
with the plumbing concealed by wainscoting, proclaimed
it, alas, of relatively ancient date. And,
for a moment, Croyden contrasted it with the
shower, the porcelain, and the tile, of his Northumberland
quarters, and shivered, ever so slightly.
It would be the hardest to get used to, he thought.
As yet, he did not know the isolation of the long,
interminably long, winter evenings, with absolutely
nothing to do and no place to go&mdash;and no one
who could understand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>At length, when they were ready to retrace their
steps to the lower floor, old Mose had disappeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone to tell his wife that the new master has
come,&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;Let us go out to the kitchen.&#8221;</p>
<p>And there they found her&mdash;bustling around,
making the fire, her head tied up in a bandana,
her sleeves rolled to the shoulders. She turned, as
they entered, and dropped them an old-fashioned
curtsy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Josephine!&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;here is Mr. Croyden,
the new master. Can you cook for him, as well
as you did for Colonel Duval?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Survent, marster,&#8221; she said to Croyden, with
another curtsy&mdash;then, to the agent, &#8220;Kin I cooks,
Marster Dick! Kin I cooks? Sut&#8217;n&#8217;y, I kin. Don&#8217;
yo t&#8217;inks dis nigger&#8217;s forgot&mdash;jest yo waits,
Marster Croyden, I shows yo, seh, sho&#8217; nuf&mdash;jest
gives me a little time to get my han&#8217; in, seh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t need much time,&#8221; Dick commented.
&#8220;The Colonel considered her very satisfactory, sir,
very satisfactory, indeed. And he was a competent
judge, sir, a very competent judge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ll get along,&#8221; said Croyden, with a
smile at Josephine. &#8220;If you could please Colonel
Duval, you will more than please me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thankee, seh!&#8221; she replied, bobbing down
again. &#8220;I sho&#8217; tries, seh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you had any experience with negro servants?&#8221;
Dick asked, as they returned to the
library.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Croyden responded: &#8220;I have always
lived at a Club.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mose and his wife are of the old times&mdash;you
can trust them, thoroughly, but there is one
thing you&#8217;ll have to remember, sir: they are nothing
but overgrown children, and you&#8217;ll have to discipline
them accordingly. They don&#8217;t know what
it is to be impertinent, sir; they have their faults,
but they are always respectful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I rely on them to do the buying?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so, sir, the Colonel did, I know. If
you wish, I&#8217;ll send you a list of the various stores,
and all you need do is to pay the bills. Is there
anything else I can do now, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;And thank you
very much for all you have done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about your baggage&mdash;can I send it out?
No trouble, sir, I assure you, no trouble. I&#8217;ll just
give your checks to the drayman, as I pass. By
the way, sir, you&#8217;ll want the telephone in, of course.
I&#8217;ll notify the Company at once. And you needn&#8217;t
fear to speak to your neighbors; they will take
it as it&#8217;s meant, sir. The next on the left is Major
Borden&#8217;s, and this, on the right, is Captain Tilghman&#8217;s,
and across the way is Captain Lashiel&#8217;s,
and Captain Carrington&#8217;s, and the house yonder,
with the huge oaks in front, is Major Markoe&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sort of a military settlement,&#8221; smiled
Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir&mdash;some of them earned their title in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
the war, and some of them in the militia and some
just inherited it from their pas. Sort of handed
down in the family, sir. The men will call on you,
promptly, too. I shouldn&#8217;t wonder some of them
will be over this evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden thought instantly of the girl he had
seen coming out of the Borden place, and who had
directed him to Clarendon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would it be safe to speak to the good-looking
girls, too&mdash;those who are my neighbors?&#8221; he asked,
with a sly smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, sir; if you tell them your name&mdash;and
don&#8217;t try to flirt with them,&#8221; Dick added, with
a laugh. &#8220;Yonder is one, now&mdash;Miss Carrington,&#8221;
nodding toward the far side of the street.</p>
<p>Croyden turned.&mdash;It was she! the girl of the blue-black
hair and slender silken ankles.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s Captain Carrington&#8217;s granddaughter,&#8221;
Dick went on with the Southerner&#8217;s love for the
definite in genealogy. &#8220;Her father and mother
both died when she was a little tot, sir, and they&mdash;that
is, the grandparents, sir&mdash;raised her.
That&#8217;s the Carrington place she&#8217;s turning in at.
Ah&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl glanced across and, recognizing Dick
(and, it must be admitted, her Clarendon inquirer
as well), nodded.</p>
<p>Both men took off their hats. But Croyden
noticed that the older man could teach him much
in the way it should be done. He did it shortly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
sharply, in the city way; Dick, slowly, deferentially,
as though it were an especial privilege to
uncover to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Carrington is a beauty!&#8221; Croyden exclaimed,
looking after her. &#8220;Are there more like
her, in Hampton?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m too old, sir, to be a competent judge,&#8221; returned
Dick, &#8220;but I should say we have several
who trot in the same class. I mean, sir&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand!&#8221; laughed Croyden. &#8220;It&#8217;s no
disrespect in a Marylander, I take it, when he
compares the ladies with his race-horses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not, sir! At least, that&#8217;s the way we
of the older generation feel; our ladies and our
horses run pretty close together. But that spirit
is fast disappearing, sir! The younger ones are
becoming&mdash;commercialized, if you please. It&#8217;s dollars
first, and <i>then</i> the ladies, with them&mdash;and the
horses nowhere. Though I don&#8217;t say it&#8217;s not wise.
Horses and the war have almost broken us, sir.
We lost the dollars, or forgot about them and
they lost themselves, whichever way it was, sir.
It&#8217;s right that our sons should start on a new
track and run the course in their own way&mdash;Yes,
sir,&#8221; suddenly recollecting himself, &#8220;Miss Carrington&#8217;s
a pretty girl, and so&#8217;s Miss Tayloe and Miss
Lashiel and a heap more. Indeed, sir, Hampton is
famed on the Eastern Sho&#8217; for her women. I&#8217;ll
attend to your baggage, and the telephone, sir,
and if there is anything else I can do, pray command
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
me. Drop in and see me when you get up
town. Good day, sir, good day.&#8221; And removing
his hat with a bow just a little less deferential
than the one he had given to Miss Carrington,
he proceeded up the street, leisurely and deliberately,
as though the world were waiting for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;And he is a real estate agent!&#8221; reflected
Croyden. &#8220;The man who, according to our way
of thinking, is the acme of hustle and bustle and
business, and schemes to trap the unwary. Truly,
the Eastern Shore has much to learn&mdash;or we have
much to unlearn! Well, I have tried the one&mdash;and
failed. Now, I&#8217;m going to try the other. It
seems to promise a quiet life, at least.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned, to find Moses in the doorway, waiting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marster Croyden,&#8221; he said, &#8220;shall I puts
yo satchel an&#8217; things in de Cun&#8217;l&#8217;s room, seh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden nodded. He did not know which was
the Colonel&#8217;s room, but it was likely to be the best
in the house, and, moreover, it was well to follow
him wherever he could.</p>
<p>&#8220;And see that my luggage is taken there, when
the man brings it,&#8221; he directed&mdash;&#8220;and tell Josephine
to have luncheon at one and dinner at seven.&#8221;</p>
<p>The darky hesitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;De Cun&#8217;l hed dinner in de middle o&#8217; de day,
seh,&#8221; he said, as though Croyden had inadvertently
erred.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>
<p>And Croyden appreciating the situation,
answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see, Moses, I&#8217;ve been used to the
other way and I reckon you will have to change
to suit me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yass, seh! yass, seh! I tell Jose. Lunch is de
same as supper, I s&#8217;pose, seh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden had to think a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that will answer&mdash;like a light
supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There may be an objection, after all, to taking
over Colonel Duval&#8217;s old servants,&#8221; he reflected.
&#8220;It may be difficult to persuade them that he is no
longer the master. I run the chance of being
ruled by a dead man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently his luggage arrived, and he went upstairs
to unpack. Moses looked, in wonder, at the
wardrobe trunk, with every suit on a separate
hanger, the drawers for shirts and linen, the apartments
for hats, and collars, and neckties, and the
shoes standing neatly in a row below.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whar&#8217;s de use atak&#8217;in de things out t&#8217;al,
Marster Croyden!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;So as to put the trunk away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sho&#8217;! I mo&#8217;nt a kno&#8217;d hit. Hit&#8217;s mons&#8217;us
strange, seh, whar yo mon&#8217;t a&#8217; kno&#8217;d ef yo&#8217;d only
stop to t&#8217;ink. F&#8217; instance, I mon&#8217;t a kno&#8217;d yo&#8217;d
cum back to Clarendon, seh, some day, cuz yo
spends yo money on hit. Heh!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then a bell tinkled softly from below.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Dyar&#8217;s dinner&mdash;I means lunch, seh,&#8221; said
Moses. &#8220;&#8217;Scuse me, seh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m ready for it,&#8221; said Croyden, as he
went to the iron wash-stand, and then slowly down
stairs to the dining-room.</p>
<p>From some place, Moses had resurrected a white
coat, yellow with its ten years&#8217; rest, and was waiting
to receive him. He drew out Croyden&#8217;s chair,
as only a family servant of the olden times can
do it, and bowed him into his place.</p>
<p>The table was set exactly as in Colonel Duval&#8217;s
day, and very prettily set, Croyden thought, with
napery spotless, and china that was thin and fine.
The latter, if he had but known it, was Lowestoft
and had served the Duvals, on that very table, for
much more than a hundred years.</p>
<p>There was cold ham, and cold chicken, lettuce
with mayonnaise, deviled eggs, preserves, with hot
corn bread and tea. When Croyden had about
finished a leisurely meal, it suddenly occurred to
him that however completely stocked Clarendon
was with things of the Past, they did not apply
to the larder, and <i>these</i> victuals were undoubtedly
fresh and particularly good.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way! Moses,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad you
were thoughtful enough to send out and purchase
these things,&#8221; with an indicating motion to
the table. &#8220;They are very satisfactory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pu&#8217;chase!&#8221; said the darky, in surprise.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
&#8220;Dese things not pu&#8217;chased. No, seh! Dey&#8217;s borro&#8217;d,
seh, from Majah Bo&#8217;den&#8217;s, yass, seh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good God!&#8221; Croyden exclaimed. &#8220;You don&#8217;t
mean you borrowed my luncheon!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yass, seh! Why not, seh? Jose jes&#8217; went ovah
an&#8217; sez to Cassie&mdash;she&#8217;s de cook, at de Majah&#8217;s,
seh&mdash;sez she, Marster Croyden don&#8217; cum and warns
some&#8217;n to eat. An&#8217; she got hit, yass, seh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it the usual thing, here, to borrow an entire
meal from the neighbor&#8217;s?&#8221; asked Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sut&#8217;n&#8217;y, seh! We borrows anything we needs
from the neighbors, an&#8217; they does de same wid us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t want any borrowing by <i>us</i>, Moses,
please remember,&#8221; said Croyden, emphatically.
&#8220;The neighbors can borrow anything we have, and
welcome, but we won&#8217;t claim the favor from them,
you understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yass, seh!&#8221; said the old darky, wonderingly.</p>
<p>Such a situation as one kitchen not borrowing
from another was incomprehensible. It had been
done by the servants from time immemorial&mdash;and,
though Croyden might forbid, yet Josephine would
continue to do it, just the same&mdash;only, less openly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And see that everything is returned not later
than to-morrow,&#8221; Croyden continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yass, seh! I tote&#8217;s dem back dis minut,
seh!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dese things, heah, whar yo didn&#8217; eat, seh&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean&mdash;Oh, Lord!&#8221; exclaimed Croyden.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, Moses. I will return them another
way. Just forget it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sut&#8217;n&#8217;y, seh,&#8221; returned the darky. &#8220;Dat&#8217;s
what I wuz gwine do in de fust place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden laughed. It was pretty hopeless, he
saw. The ways they had, were the ways that would
hold them. He might protest, and order otherwise,
until doomsday, but it would not avail. For them,
it was sufficient if Colonel Duval permitted it, or
if it were the custom.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I shall let the servants manage me,&#8221;
he thought. &#8220;They know the ways, down here,
and, besides, it&#8217;s the line of least resistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went into the library, and, settling himself
in a comfortable chair, lit a cigarette.... It
was the world turned upside down. Less than
twenty-four hours ago it was money and madness,
bankruptcy and divorce courts, the automobile pace&mdash;the
devil&#8217;s own. Now, it was quiet and gentility,
easy-living and refinement. Had he been in Hampton
a little longer, he would have added: gossip
and tittle-tattle, small-mindedness and silly vanity.</p>
<p>He smoked cigarette after cigarette and dreamed.
He wondered what Elaine Cavendish had done last
evening&mdash;if she had dined at the Club-house, and
what gown she had worn, if she had played golf
in the afternoon, or tennis, and with whom; he
wondered what she would do this evening&mdash;wondered
if she thought of him more than casually. He shook
it off for a moment. Then he wondered again:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
who had his old quarters at the Heights? He
knew a number who would be jumping for them&mdash;who
had his old table for breakfast? it, too, would
be eagerly sought&mdash;who would take his place on
the tennis and the golf teams?&mdash;what Macloud was
doing? Fine chap was Macloud! the only man in
Northumberland he would trust, the only man in
Northumberland, likely, who would care a rap
whether he came back or whether he didn&#8217;t, or who
would ever give him a second thought. He wondered
if Gaspard, his particular waiter, missed him?
yes, he would miss the tips, at least; yes, and the
boy who brushed his clothes and drew his bath
would miss him, and his caddie, as well. Every one
whom he <i>paid</i>, would miss him....</p>
<p>He threw away his cigarette and sat up sharply.
It was not pleasant thinking.</p>
<p>An old mahogany slant-top escritoire, in the
corner by the window, caught his eye. It had a
shell, inlaid in maple, in the front, and the parquetry,
also, ran around the edges of the drawers
and up the sides.</p>
<p>There was one like it in the Cavendish library,
he remembered. He went over to it, and, the key
being in the lock, drew out pulls and turned back
the top. Inside, there was the usual lot of pigeon
holes and small drawers, with compartments for
deeds and larger papers. All were empty. Either
Colonel Duval, in anticipation of death, had cleaned
it out, or Moses and Josephine, for their better
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
preservation, had packed the contents away. He
was glad of it; he could use it, at least, without
ejecting the Colonel.</p>
<p>He closed the lid and had turned away, when the
secret drawer, which, sometimes, was in these old
desks, occurred to him. He went back and began
to search for it.... And, presently, he found it.
Under the middle drawer was a sliding panel that
rolled back, when he pressed on a carved lion&#8217;s head
ornamentation, and which concealed a hidden recess.
In this recess lay a paper.</p>
<p>It was yellow with age, and, when Croyden took
it in his fingers, he caught the faint odor of sandal
wood. It was brittle in the creases, and threatened
to fall apart. So, opening it gently, he spread it
on the desk before him. Here is what he read:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<div class='ra'>
<p style=' margin-right:2em;'>&#8220;Annapolis, 10 May, 1738.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Honoured Sir:</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear that I am about to Clear for my Last
Voyage&mdash;the old wounds trouble me, more and more,
especially those in my head and chest. I am confined
to my bed, and though Doctor Waldron does
not say it, I know he thinks I am bound for Davy
Jones&#8217; locker. So be it&mdash;I&#8217;ve lived to a reasonable
Age, and had a fair Time in the living. I&#8217;ve done
that which isn&#8217;t according to Laws, either of Man
or God&mdash;but for the Former, I was not Caught, and
for the Latter, I&#8217;m willing to chance him in death.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
When you were last in Annapolis, I intended to
mention a Matter to you, but something prevented,
I know not what, and you got Away ere I was
aware of it. Now, fearing lest I Die before you
come again, I will Write it, though it is against the
Doctor&#8217;s orders&mdash;which, however, I obey only when
it pleases me.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are familiar with certain Episodes in my
Early Life, spent under the Jolly Roger on the
Spanish Main, and you have maintained Silence&mdash;for
which I shall always be your debtor. You have,
moreover, always been my Friend, and for that, I
am more than your debtor. It is, therefore, but
Mete that you should be my Heir&mdash;and I have this
day Executed my last Will and Testament, bequeathing
to you all my Property and effects. It
is left with Mr. Dulany, the Attorney, who wrote
it, to be probated in due Season.</p>
<p>&#8220;But there still remains a goodly portion which,
for obvious reasons, may not be so disposed of. I
mean my buried Treasure. I buried it in September,
1720, shortly after I came to Annapolis, trusting
not to keep so great an Amount in my House. It
amounts to about half my Fortune, and Approximates
near to Fifty Thousand Pounds, though
that may be but a crude Estimate at best, for I am
not skilled in the judging of Precious Stones. Where
I obtained this wealth, I need not mention, though
you can likely guess. And as there is nothing by
which it can be identified, you can use it without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
Hesitation. Subject, however, to one Restriction:
As it was not honestly come by (according to the
World&#8217;s estimate, because, forsooth, I only risked
my Life in the gathering, instead of pilfering it
from my Fellow man in Business, which is the accepted
fashion) I ask you not to use it except in
an Extremity of Need. If that need does not arise
in your Life, you, in turn, may pass this letter on
to your heir, and he, in turn, to his heir, and so
on, until such Time as the Need may come, and the
Restriction be lifted. And now to find the
Treasure:&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven hundred and fifty feet&mdash;and at right
angles to the water line&mdash;from the extreme
tip of Greenberry Point, below Annapolis, where
the Severn runs into the Chesapeake, are four large
Beech trees, standing as of the corners of a Square,
though not equidistant. Bisect this Square, by
two lines drawn from the Corners. At a Point
three hundred and thirty feet, North-by-North-East,
from where these two lines intersect and at a
depth of Six feet, you will come upon an Iron Box.
It contains the Treasure. And I wish you (or whoever
recovers it) Joy of it!&mdash;as much joy with it as
I had in the Gathering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lest I die before you come again to Annapolis,
I shall leave this letter with Mr. Dulany, to be
delivered to you on the First Occasion. I judge
him as one who will respect a Dead man&#8217;s seal. If
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
I see you not again, Farewell. I am, sir, with
great respect,</p>

</div>
<p>And below that:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;The Extremity of Need brushed by me so close
I heard the rustling of its gown, but I did not dig.
I have sufficient for me, and I am the last of my
line. I pass it, therefore, to my good friend Hugh
Croyden (and, in the event that he predecease me,
to his son Geoffrey Croyden), to whom Clarendon
will go upon my demise.</p>

<p>Croyden read the last endorsement again; then
he smiled, and the smile broadened into an audible
laugh.</p>
<p>The heir of a pirate! Well, at least, it promised
something to engage him, if time hung heavily on
his hands. The Duvals seem to have taken the
bequest seriously&mdash;so, why not he? And, though
the extremity of need seems never to have reached
them, it was peculiar that none of the family had
inspected the locality and satisfied himself of the
accuracy of the description. The extreme tip of
Greenberry Point had shifted, a dozen times, likely,
in a hundred and ninety years, and the four beech
trees had long since disappeared, but there was no
note of these facts to aid the search. He must
start just where Robert Parmenter had left off:
with the letter.</p>
<p>He found an old history of Maryland in the
book-case. It contained a map. Annapolis was
somewhere on the Western Shore, he knew. He
ran his eyes down the Chesapeake. Yes, here it was&mdash;with
Greenberry Point just across the Severn.
So much of the letter was accurate, at least. The
rest would bear investigation. Some time soon he
would go across, and take a look over the ground.
Greenberry Point, for all he knew, might be built
up with houses, or blown half a mile inland, or
turned into a fort, or anything. It was not likely
to have remained the same, as in Parmenter&#8217;s day;
and, yet, if it had changed, why should not the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
Duvals have remarked it, in making their endorsements.</p>
<p>He put the letter back in the secret compartment,
where it had rested for so many years.
Evidently, Colonel Duval had forgotten it, in his
last brief illness. And Fortune had helped him
in the finding. Would it help him to the treasure
as well? For with him, the restriction was lifted&mdash;the
extremity of need was come. Moreover, it
was time that the letter should be put to the test.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
<h2>V</h2>
<h3>MISS CARRINGTON</h3>
</div>

<p>Croyden was sitting before the house, later in
the afternoon, when an elderly gentleman, returning
leisurely from town, turned in at the Clarendon
gates.</p>
<p>&#8220;My first caller,&#8221; thought Croyden, and immediately
he arose and went forward to meet him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Permit me to present myself, sir,&#8221; said the
newcomer. &#8220;I am Charles Carrington.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very glad to meet you, Captain Carrington,&#8221;
said Croyden, taking the proffered hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is your first visit to Hampton, I believe,
sir,&#8221; the Captain remarked, when they were seated
under the trees. &#8220;It is not Northumberland, sir;
we haven&#8217;t the push, and the bustle, and the smoke,
but we have a pleasant little town, sir, and we&#8217;re
glad to welcome you here. I think you will like
it. It&#8217;s a long time since Clarendon had a tenant,
sir. Colonel Duval&#8217;s been dead nearly ten years
now. Your father and he were particular friends,
I believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden assured him that such was the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, the Colonel often spoke of him to
me with great affection. I can&#8217;t say I was surprised
to know that he had made him his heir. He
was the last of the Duvals&mdash;not even a collateral
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
in the family&mdash;there was only one child to a generation,
sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>Manifestly, it was not known in Hampton how
Hugh Croyden came to be the Colonel&#8217;s heir, and,
indeed, friendship had prompted the money-loan,
without security other than the promise of the
ultimate transfer of Clarendon and its contents.
And Croyden, respecting the Colonel&#8217;s wish, evident
now, though unexpressed either to his father or himself,
resolved to treat the place as a gift, and to
suppress the fact that there had been an ample
and adequate consideration.</p>
<p>After a short visit, Captain Carrington arose to
go.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come over and take supper with us, this evening,
sir,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I want you to meet Mrs.
Carrington and my granddaughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come with pleasure,&#8221; Croyden answered,
thinking of the girl with the blue-black hair and
slender ankles.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the house yonder, with the white pillars&mdash;at
half-after-six, then, sir.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>As Croyden approached the Carrington house,
he encountered Miss Carrington on the walk.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have met before,&#8221; she said, as he bowed
over her hand. &#8220;I was your original guide to
Clarendon. Have you forgot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have I forgot?&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;Do you
think it possible?&#8221; looking her in the eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you wanted to hear me say it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to know if you could say it,&#8221; she
answered, gayly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And how have I succeeded?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Admirably!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sufficiently well to pass muster?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Muster&mdash;for what?&#8221; she asked, with a sly
smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;For enrollment among your victims.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I put your name on the list&mdash;at the
foot?&#8221; she laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why at the foot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The last comer&mdash;you have to work your way
up by merit, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which consists in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>That</i> you will have to discover.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall try,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Is it so very difficult
of discovery?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it should not be so difficult&mdash;for you,&#8221;
she answered, with a flash of her violet eyes.
&#8220;Mother!&#8221; as they reached the piazza&mdash;&#8220;let me
present Mr. Croyden.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Carrington arose to greet him&mdash;a tall,
slender woman, whose age was sixty, at least, but
who appeared not a day over forty-five, despite
the dark gown and little lace cap she was wearing.
She seemed what the girl had called her&mdash;the
mother, rather than the grandmother. And when
she smiled!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Carrington two generations hence. Lord!
how do they do it?&#8221; thought Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;You play Bridge, of course, Mr. Croyden,&#8221;
said Miss Carrington, when the dessert was being
served.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like it very much,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was sure you did&mdash;so sure, indeed, I asked
a few friends in later&mdash;for a rubber or two&mdash;and
to meet you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s well for me I play,&#8221; he smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is indeed!&#8221; laughed Mrs. Carrington&mdash;&#8220;that
is, if you care aught for Davila&#8217;s good
opinion. If one can&#8217;t play Bridge one would better
not be born.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you know Mother a little better, Mr.
Croyden, you will recognize that she is inclined to
exaggerate at times,&#8221; said Miss Carrington. &#8220;I
admit that I am fond of the game, that I like
to play with people who know how, and who, at
the critical moment, are not always throwing the
wrong card&mdash;you understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In other words, you haven&#8217;t any patience with
stupidity,&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;Nor have I&mdash;but we
sometimes forget that a card player is born, not
made. All the drilling and teaching one can do
won&#8217;t give card sense to one who hasn&#8217;t any.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Precisely!&#8221; Miss Carrington exclaimed, &#8220;and
life is too short to bother with such people. They
may be very charming otherwise, but not across
the Bridge table.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yet ought you not to forgive them their misplays,
just because they are charming?&#8221; Mrs.
Carrington asked. &#8220;If you were given your choice
between a poor player who is charming, and a good
player who is disagreeable, which would you choose,
Mr. Croyden?&mdash;Come, now be honest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would depend upon the size of the game,&#8221;
Croyden responded. &#8220;If it were half a cent a
point, I should choose the charming partner, but
if it were five cents or better, I am inclined to
think I should prefer the good player.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll remember that,&#8221; said Miss Carrington. &#8220;As
we don&#8217;t play, here, for money stakes, you won&#8217;t
care if your partner isn&#8217;t very expert.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;The stipulation
is that she shall be charming. I should be willing
to take <i>you</i> for a partner though you trumped my
ace and forgot my lead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Merci</i>, <i>Monsieur</i>,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Though you
know I should do neither.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever play poker?&#8221; Captain Carrington asked,
suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Occasionally,&#8221; smiled Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! We&#8217;ll go down to the Club, some evening.
We old fellows aren&#8217;t much on Bridge, but
we can handle a pair or three of-a-kind, pretty
good. Have some sherry, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must not let the Captain beguile you,&#8221;
interposed Mrs. Carrington. &#8220;The men all play
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
poker with us,&mdash;it is a heritage of the old days&mdash;though
the youngsters are breaking away from it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And taking up Bridge!&#8221; the Captain ejaculated.
&#8220;And it is just as well&mdash;we have sense
enough to stop before we&#8217;re broke, but they
haven&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To hear father talk, you would think that
the present generation is no earthly good!&#8221; smiled
Miss Carrington. &#8220;Yet I suppose, when he was
young, his elders held the same opinion of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare say!&#8221; laughed the Captain. &#8220;The
old ones always think the young ones have a lot to
learn&mdash;and they have, sir, they have! But it&#8217;s
of another sort than we can teach them, I reckon.&#8221;
He pushed back his chair. &#8220;We&#8217;ll smoke on the
piazza, sir&mdash;the ladies don&#8217;t object.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they passed out, a visitor was just ascending
the steps. Miss Carrington gave a smothered exclamation
and went forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do, Miss Erskine!&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do, my dear!&#8221; returned Miss
Erskine, &#8220;and Mrs. Carrington&mdash;and the dear Captain,
too.&mdash;I&#8217;m charmed to find you all at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>She spoke with an affected drawl that would
have been amusing in a handsome woman, but was
absurdly ridiculous in one with her figure and
unattractive face.</p>
<p>She turned expectantly toward Croyden, and Miss
Carrington presented him.</p>
<p>&#8220;So this is the new owner of Clarendon,&#8221; she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
gurgled with an &#8216;a&#8217; so broad it impeded her speech.
&#8220;You have kept us waiting a long time, Mr.
Croyden. We began to think you a myth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you will find me a very husky myth,&#8221;
Croyden answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Husky&#8217; is scarcely the correct word, Mr.
Croyden; <i>animated</i> would be better, I think. We
scholars, you know, do not like to hear a word
used in a perverted sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>She waddled to a chair and settled into it.
Croyden shot an amused glance toward Miss Carrington,
and received one in reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I suppose not,&#8221; he said, amiably. &#8220;But,
then, you know, I am not a scholar.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Erskine smiled in a superior sort of way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very few of us are properly careful of our
mode of speech,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;And, oh! Mr.
Croyden, I hope you intend to open Clarendon, so
as to afford those of us who care for such things,
the pleasure of studying the pictures, and the china,
and the furniture. I am told it contains a Stuart
and a Peale&mdash;and they should not be hidden from
those who can appreciate them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I assume you&#8217;re talking of pictures,&#8221; said
Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am, sir,&mdash;most assuredly!&#8221; the dame
answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I must confess ignorance, again,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t know a Stuart from a&mdash;chromo.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></p>
<p>Miss Erskine gave a little shriek of horror.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not believe it, Mr. Croyden!&mdash;you&#8217;re playing
on my credulity. I shall have to give you some
instructions. I will lecture on Stuart and Peale,
and the painters of their period, for your especial
delectation&mdash;and soon, very soon!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it would all be wasted,&#8221; said
Croyden. &#8220;I&#8217;m not fond of art, I confess&mdash;except
on the commercial side; and if I&#8217;ve any pictures,
at Clarendon, worth money, I&#8217;ll be for selling them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Mrs. Carrington! Will you listen&mdash;did you
ever hear such heresy?&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
believe it of you, Mr. Croyden. Let me lend you
an article on Stuart to read. I shall bring it out
to Clarendon to-morrow morning&mdash;and you can let
me look at all the dear treasures, while you peruse
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Croyden has an appointment with me to-morrow,
Amelia,&#8221; said Carrington, quickly&mdash;and
Croyden gave him a look of gratitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be but a pleasure deferred, then, Mr.
Croyden,&#8221; said Miss Erskine, impenetrable in her
self conceit. &#8220;The next morning will do, quite
as well&mdash;I shall come at ten o&#8217;clock&mdash;What a lovely
evening this is, Mrs. Carrington!&#8221; preparing to
patronize her hostess.</p>
<p>The Captain snorted with sudden anger, and,
abruptly excusing himself, disappeared in the
library. Miss Carrington stayed a moment, then,
with a word to Croyden, that she would show him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
the article now, before the others came, if Miss
Erskine would excuse them a moment, bore him off.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of her?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pompous and stupid&mdash;an irritating nuisance,
I should call her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s more!&mdash;she is the most arrogant, self-opinionated,
self-complacent, vapid piece of humanity
in this town or any other town. She irritates
me to the point of impoliteness. She never
sees that people don&#8217;t want her. She&#8217;s as dense
as asphalt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very amusing!&#8221; Croyden interjected.</p>
<p>&#8220;At first, yes&mdash;pretty soon you will be throwing
things at her&mdash;or wanting to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s art crazy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Dilettanteism
gone mad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t only Art. She thinks she&#8217;s qualified
to speak on every subject under the sun, Literature&mdash;Bridge&mdash;Teaching&mdash;Music.
Oh, she is intolerable!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What fits her for assuming universal knowledge?&#8221;
asked Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heaven only knows! She went away to some
preparatory school, and finished off with another
that teaches pedagogy. Straightway she became
an adept in the art of instruction, though, when
she tried it, she had the whole academy by the ears
in two weeks, and the faculty asked her to resign.
Next, she got some one to take her to Europe&mdash;spent
six weeks in looking at a lot of the famous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
paintings, with the aid of a guide book and a
catalogue, and came home prepared to lecture on
Art&mdash;and, what&#8217;s more, she has the effrontery to
do it&mdash;for the benefit of Charity, she takes four-fifths
of the proceeds, and Charity gets the
balance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Music came next. She read the lives of Chopin
and Wagner and some of the other composers, went
to a half dozen symphony concerts, looked up
theory, voice culture, and the like, in the encyclopædias,
and now she&#8217;s a critic! Literature she imbibed
from the bottle, I suppose&mdash;it came easy to
<i>her</i>! And she passes judgment upon it with the utmost
ease and final authority. And as for Bridge!
She doesn&#8217;t hesitate to arraign Elwell, and we, of the
village, are the very dirt beneath her feet. I hear
she&#8217;s thinking of taking up Civic Improvement. I
hope it is true&mdash;she&#8217;ll likely run up against somebody
who won&#8217;t hesitate to tell her what an idiot
she is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you tolerate her?&#8221; Croyden asked.
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you throw her out of society, metaphorically
speaking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t: she belongs&mdash;which is final with us,
you know. Moreover, she has imposed on some,
with her assumption of superiority, and they kowtow
to her in a way that is positively disgusting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you, and the rest who dislike her,
snub her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Snub <i>her</i>! You can&#8217;t snub her&mdash;she never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
takes a snub to herself. If you were to hit her in
the face, she would think it a mistake and meant for
some one else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, why not do the next best thing&mdash;have
fun with her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We do&mdash;but even that grows monotonous, with
such a mountain of Egotism&mdash;she will stay for the
Bridge this evening, see if she doesn&#8217;t&mdash;and never
imagine she&#8217;s not wanted.&#8221; Then she laughed:
&#8220;I think if she does I&#8217;ll give her to you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good!&#8221; said he. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather enjoy it.
If she is any more cantankerous than some of the
women at the Heights, she&#8217;ll be an interesting
study. Yes, I&#8217;ll be glad to play a rubber with
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you start, you&#8217;ll play the entire evening
with her&mdash;we don&#8217;t change partners, here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what will <i>you</i> do?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look on&mdash;at the <i>other</i> table. She will have
my place. I was going to play with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the greater the sacrifice I&#8217;m making, the
greater the credit I should receive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It depends&mdash;on how you acquit yourself,&#8221;
she said gayly. &#8220;There are the others, now&mdash;come
along.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were six of them. Miss Tilghman, Miss
Lashiel and Miss Tayloe, Mr. Dangerfield, Mr.
Leigh, and Mr. Byrd. They all had heard of
Croyden&#8217;s arrival, in Hampton, and greeted him
as they would one of themselves. And it impressed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
him, as possibly nothing else could have done&mdash;for
it was distinctly new to him, after the manners
of chilliness and aloofness which were the ways of
Northumberland.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going to play Bridge, Miss Erskine,
will you stay and join us?&#8221; asked Miss Carrington.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be charmed! charmed!&#8221; was the answer.
&#8220;This is an ideal evening for Bridge, don&#8217;t you
think so, Mr. Croyden?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s what we <i>thought</i>!&#8221; said Miss
Tilghman, dryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And who is to play with me, dear Davila?&#8221;
Miss Erskine inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to put Mr. Croyden with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How nice of you! But I warn you, Mr.
Croyden, I am a very exacting partner. I may
find fault with you, if you violate rules&mdash;just draw
your attention to it, you know, so you will not let
it occur again. I cannot abide blunders, Mr.
Croyden&mdash;there is no excuse for them, except stupidity,
and stupidity should put one out of the
game.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try to do my very best,&#8221; said Croyden
humbly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not doubt that you will,&#8221; she replied
easily, her manner plainly implying further that
she would soon see how much that &#8220;best&#8221; was.</p>
<p>As they went in to the drawing-room, where the
tables were arranged, Miss Erskine leading, with
a feeling of divine right and an appearance of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
Teddy bear, Byrd leaned over to Croyden and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s the limit!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; said Leigh, &#8220;she&#8217;s past the limit; she&#8217;s
the sublimated It!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which is another way of saying, she&#8217;s a superlative
d&mdash;&mdash; fool!&#8221; Dangerfield ended.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I understand!&#8221; Croyden laughed. &#8220;Before
you came, she tackled me on Art, and, when
I confessed to only the commercial side, and an
intention to sell the Stuart and Peale, which, it
seems, are at Clarendon, the pitying contempt was
almost too much for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My Lord! why weren&#8217;t we here!&#8221; exclaimed
Byrd.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s coming out to inspect my &#8216;treasures,&#8217; on
Thursday morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Self invited?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I rather think so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall turn her over to Moses, and decamp
before she gets there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, we are waiting!&#8221; came Miss
Erskine&#8217;s voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Lord! the old dragoon!&#8221; said Leigh. &#8220;I
trust I&#8217;m not at her table.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he was not&mdash;Miss Tilghman and Dangerfield
were designated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come over and help to keep me straight,&#8221;
Croyden whispered to Miss Carrington.</p>
<p>She shook her head at him with a roguish smile.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find your partner amply able to keep
you straight,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>The game began. Miss Tilghman won the cut
and made it a Royal Spade.</p>
<p>&#8220;They no longer play Royal Spades in New
York,&#8221; said Miss Erskine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know about New York,&#8221; returned Miss
Tilghman, placidly, &#8220;but <i>we&#8217;re</i> playing them here,
this evening. Your lead, Miss Amelia.&#8221;</p>
<p>The latter shut her thick lips tightly, an instant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, I suppose we must be provincial a
little longer,&#8221; she said, sarcastically. &#8220;Of course,
you do not still play Royal Spades in Northumberland,
Mr. Croyden.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed! Play anything to keep the game
moving,&#8221; Croyden answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, to be sure! I forgot, for the instant, that
Northumberland <i>is</i> a rapid town.&mdash;I call that card,
Edith&mdash;the King of Hearts!&#8221; as Miss Tilghman
inadvertently exposed it.</p>
<p>A moment later, Miss Tilghman, through anger,
also committed a revoke, which her play on the succeeding
trick disclosed.</p>
<p>That it was a game for pure pleasure, without
stakes, made no difference to Miss Erskine. Technically
it was a revoke, and she was within her
rights when she exclaimed it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Three tricks!&#8221; she said exultantly, &#8220;and you
cannot make game this hand.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very sorry, partner,&#8221; Miss Tilghman
apologized.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s entirely excusable under the circumstances,&#8221;
said Dangerfield, with deliberate accent. &#8220;You may
do it again!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How courteous Mr. Dangerfield is,&#8221; Miss
Erskine smiled. &#8220;To my mind, nothing excuses
a revoke except sudden blindness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you would claim it even then, I suppose?&#8221;
Dangerfield retorted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said, sudden blindness was the only excuse,
Mr. Dangerfield. Had you observed my language
more closely, you doubtless would have understood.&mdash;It
is your lead, partner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dangerfield, with a wink at Croyden, subsided,
and the hand was finished, as was the next, when
Croyden was dummy, without further jangling.
But midway in the succeeding hand, Miss Erskine
began.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Mr. Croyden,&#8221; she said, &#8220;when you
have the Ace, King, and <i>no more</i> in a suit, you
should lead the Ace and then the King, to show
that you have no more&mdash;give the down-and-out
signal. We would have made an extra trick, if
you had done so&mdash;I could have given you a diamond
to trump. As it was, you led the King and then
the Ace, and I supposed, of course, you had at
least four in suit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very sorry; I&#8217;ll try to remember in future,&#8221;
said Croyden with affected contrition.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></p>
<p>But, at the end of the hand, he was in disgrace
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;If your original lead had been from your
fourth best, partner, I could have understood you,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;As it was, you misinformed me. Under
the rule of eleven, I had but the nine to beat, I
played the ten and Mr. Dangerfield covered with
the Knave, which by the rule you should have
held. We lost another trick by it, you see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad&mdash;too bad!&#8221; Croyden answered;
&#8220;that&#8217;s two tricks we&#8217;ve lost by my stupid playing.
I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m pretty ignorant, Miss Erskine, for
I don&#8217;t know what is meant by the rule of eleven.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Erskine&#8217;s manner of cutting the cards was
somewhat indicative of her contempt&mdash;lingeringly,
softly, putting them down as though she scorned
to touch them except with the tips of her fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rule of eleven is usually one of the first
things learned by a beginner at Bridge,&#8221; she said,
witheringly. &#8220;I do not always agree with Mr.
Elwell, some of whose reasoning and inferences,
in my opinion, are much forced, but his definition
of this rule is very fair. I give it in his exact
words, which are: &#8216;Deduct the size of the card
led from eleven, and the difference will show how
many cards, higher than the one led, are held outside
the leader&#8217;s hand.&#8217; For example: if you lead
a seven then there are four higher than the seven
in the other three hands.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I see!&#8221; Croyden exclaimed. &#8220;What a bully
rule!&mdash;It&#8217;s very informing, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s very informing&mdash;in more ways than
one,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>Whereat Miss Tilghman laughed outright, and
Dangerfield had to retrieve a card from the floor,
to hide his merriment.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the hilarity?&#8221; asked Miss Carrington,
coming over to their table. &#8220;You people seem to
be enjoying the game.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which sent Miss Tilghman into a gale of
laughter, in which Dangerfield joined.</p>
<p>Miss Erskine frowned in disapproval and astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind them, Mr. Croyden,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;They really know better, but this is the silly
season, I suppose. They have much to learn, too&mdash;much
to learn, indeed.&#8221; She turned to Miss Carrington.
&#8220;I was explaining a few things about
the game to Mr. Croyden, Davila, the rule of eleven
and the Ace-King lead, and, for some reason, it
seemed to move them to jollity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m astonished!&#8221; exclaimed Miss Carrington,
her violet eyes gleaming with suppressed mirth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope Mr. Croyden does not think we were
laughing at <i>him</i>!&#8221; cried Miss Tilghman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not!&#8221; returned Croyden solemnly,
&#8220;and, if you were, my stupidity quite justified it,
I&#8217;m sure. If Miss Erskine will only bear with me,
I&#8217;ll try to learn&mdash;Bully thing, that rule of eleven!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></p>
<p>It was now Croyden&#8217;s deal and the score, games
all&mdash;Miss Erskine having made thirty-six on hers,
and Dangerfield having added enough to Miss
Tilghman&#8217;s twenty-eight to, also, give them game.</p>
<p>&#8220;How cleverly you deal the cards,&#8221; Miss Erskine
remarked. &#8220;You&#8217;re particularly nimble in the
fingers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I acquired it dealing faro,&#8221; Croyden returned,
innocently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Faro!&#8221; exclaimed Miss Carrington, choking
back a laugh. &#8220;What is faro?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A game about which you should know nothing,
my dear,&#8221; Miss Erskine interposed. &#8220;Faro
is played only in gambling hells and mining
camps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And in some of the Clubs <i>in New York</i>,&#8221;
Croyden added&mdash;at which Miss Tilghman&#8217;s mirth
burst out afresh. &#8220;That&#8217;s where I learned to
copper the ace or to play it open.&mdash;I&#8217;ll make it no
trumps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll double!&#8221; said Miss Tilghman.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go back!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Content.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody will win the rubber, this hand,&#8221;
Miss Erskine platitudinized,&mdash;with the way such
persons have of announcing a self evident fact&mdash;as
she spread out her hand. &#8220;It is fair support,
partner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden nodded. Then proceeded with much apparent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
thought and deliberation, to play the hand
like the veriest tyro.</p>
<p>Miss Erskine fidgeted in her seat, gave half
smothered exclamations, looked at him appealingly
at every misplay. All with no effect. Croyden
was wrapped in the game&mdash;utterly oblivious to anything
but the cards&mdash;leading the wrong one, throwing
the wrong one, matching pasteboards, that
was all.</p>
<p>Miss Erskine was frantic. And when, at the
last, holding only a thirteener and a fork in Clubs,
he led the losing card of the latter, she could endure
the agony no longer.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is five tricks you have lost, Mr. Croyden,
to say nothing of the rubber!&#8221; she snapped. &#8220;I
must go, now&mdash;a delightful game! thank you, my
dear Davila. So much obliged to you all, don&#8217;t
you know. Ah, Captain Carrington, will you see
me as far as the front gate?&mdash;I won&#8217;t disturb the
game. Davila can take my place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll take her to the gate!&#8221; muttered the
Captain aside to Croyden, who was the very picture
of contrition. &#8220;But if she only were a man!
Are you ready, Amelia?&#8221; and he bowed her out.</p>
<p>&#8220;You awful man!&#8221; cried Miss Carrington.
&#8220;How could you do it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it was lovely&mdash;perfectly lovely!&#8221; exclaimed
Miss Tilghman.&mdash;&#8220;Oh! that last hand was
too funny for words.&mdash;If only you could have seen
her face, Mr. Croyden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t dare!&#8221; laughed he. &#8220;One look, and
I&#8217;d have given the whole thing away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She never suspected.&mdash;I tell you, she is as dense
as asphalt,&#8221; said Miss Carrington. &#8220;Come, now
we&#8217;ll have some Bridge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll try to observe the rule of eleven!&#8221;
said Croyden.</p>
<p>He lingered a moment, after the game was ended
and the others had gone. When he came to say
good-night, he held Miss Carrington&#8217;s slender
fingers a second longer than the occasion justified.</p>
<p>&#8220;And may I come again soon?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;As often as you wish,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;You
have the advantage of proximity, at least.&#8221;</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
<h2>VI</h2>
<h3>CONFIDENCE AND SCRUPLES</h3>
</div>

<p>The next month, to Croyden, went pleasantly
enough. He was occupied with getting the household
machinery to run according to his ideas&mdash;and
still retain Moses and Josephine, who, he early
discovered, were invaluable to him; in meeting the
people worth knowing in the town and vicinity,
and in being entertained, and entertaining&mdash;all very
quietly and without ostentation.</p>
<p>He had dined, or supped, or played Bridge at
all the houses, had given a few small things himself,
and ended by paying off all scores with a
garden party at Clarendon, which Mrs. Carrington
had managed for him with exquisite taste (and,
to him, amazing frugality)&mdash;and, more wonderful
still, with an entire effacement of <i>self</i>. It was
Croyden&#8217;s party throughout, though her hand was
at the helm, her brain directed&mdash;and Hampton never
knew.</p>
<p>And the place <i>had</i> looked attractive; with the
house set in its wide sweep of velvety lawn
amid great trees and old-fashioned flowers and
hedges. With the furniture cleaned and polished,
the old china scattered in cupboard and on table, the
portraits and commissions freshly dusted, the
swords glistening as of yore.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>And in that month, Croyden had come to like
Hampton immensely. The absence, in its society,
of all attempts at show, to make-believe, to impress,
to hoodwink, was refreshingly novel to him,
who, hitherto, had known it only as a great sham,
a huge affectation, with every one striving to outdo
everyone else, and all as hollow as a rotten
gourd.</p>
<p>He had not got used, however, to the individual
espionage of the country town&mdash;the habit of watching
one&#8217;s every movement, and telling it, and drawing
inferences therefrom&mdash;inferences tinctured according
to the personal feelings of the inferer.</p>
<p>He learned that, in three weeks, they had him
&#8220;taken&#8221; with every eligible girl in town, engaged
to four and undecided as to two more. They busied
themselves with his food,&mdash;they nosed into his
drinks, his cigars, his cigarettes, his pipes,&mdash;they
bothered themselves about his meal hours,&mdash;they
even inspected his wash when it hung on the line!
Some of them, that is. The rest were totally different;
they let every one alone. They did not
intrude nor obtrude&mdash;they went their way, and permitted
every one to go his.</p>
<p>So much had been the way of Northumberland,
so much he had been used to always. But&mdash;and
here was the difference from Northumberland, the
vital difference, indeed&mdash;they were interested in you,
if <i>you</i> wished them to be&mdash;and it was genuine interest,
not pretense. This, and the way they had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
treated him as one of them, because Colonel Duval
had been his father&#8217;s friend, made Croyden feel
very much at home.</p>
<p>At intervals, he had taken old Parmenter&#8217;s letter
from its secret drawer, and studied it, but he
had been so much occupied with getting acquainted,
that he had done nothing else. Moreover, there
was no pressing need for haste. If the treasure
had kept on Greenberry Point for one hundred and
ninety years, it would keep a few months longer.
Besides, he was a bit uncertain whether or not he
should confide in someone, Captain Carrington or
Major Borden. He would doubtless need another
man to help him, even if the location should be
easily determined, which, however, was most unlikely.
For him, alone, to go prying about on
Greenberry Point, would surely occasion comment
and arouse suspicion&mdash;which would not be so likely
if there were two of them, and especially if one
were a well-known resident of Maryland.</p>
<p>He finally determined, however, to go across to
Annapolis and look over the ground, before he
disclosed the secret to any one. Which was the
reasonable decision.</p>
<p>When he came to look up the matter of transportation,
however, he was surprised to find that no
boat ran between Annapolis and Hampton&mdash;or any
other port on the Eastern Shore. He either had to
go by water to Baltimore (which was available on
only three days a week) and thence finish his journey
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
by rail or transfer to another boat, or else he had to
go by steam cars north to Wilmington, and then
directly south again to Annapolis. In either case,
a day&#8217;s journey between two towns that were almost
within seeing distance of each other, across the
Bay. Of the two, he chose to go by boat to
Baltimore.</p>
<p>Then, the afternoon of the day before it sailed,
he received a wire&mdash;delivered two hours and more
after its receipt, in the leisurely fashion of the
Eastern Shore. It was from Macloud, and dated
Philadelphia.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Can I come down to-night? Answer to Bellevue-Stratford.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>His reply brought Macloud in the morning train.</p>
<p>Croyden met him at the station. Moses took
his bag, and they walked out to Clarendon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry I haven&#8217;t a car!&#8221; said Croyden&mdash;then
he laughed. &#8220;The truth is, Colin, they&#8217;re not
popular down here. The old families won&#8217;t have
them&mdash;they&#8217;re innovations&mdash;the saddle horse and
the family carriage are still to the fore with them.
Only the butcher, and the baker and the candlestick
maker have motors. There&#8217;s one, now&mdash;he&#8217;s the
candlestick maker, I think. This town is nothing
if not conservative. It reminds me of the one down
South, where they wouldn&#8217;t have electric cars.
Finally all the street car horses died. Then rather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
than commit the awful sin of letting <i>new</i> horses
come into the city, they accepted the trolley. The
fashion suits my pocketbook, however, so I&#8217;ve no
kick coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want with a car here, anyway?&#8221;
Macloud asked. &#8220;It looks as if you could walk
from one end of the town to the other in fifteen
minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can, easily.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the baker et cetera have theirs only for
show, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s about it&mdash;the roads, hereabout, are
sandy and poor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, I&#8217;m with your old families. They may
be conservative, at times a trifle too much so, but,
in the main, their judgment&#8217;s pretty reliable, according
to conditions. What sort of place did you
find&mdash;I mean the house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very fair!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the society?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Much better than Northumberland.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hum&mdash;I see&mdash;the aristocracy of birth, not dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly!&mdash;How do you do, Mr. Fitzhugh,&#8221;
as they passed a policeman in uniform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Mr. Croyden!&#8221; was the answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;There! that illustrates,&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;You
meet Fitzhugh every place when he is off duty. He
<i>belongs</i>. His occupation does not figure, in the
least.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So you like it&mdash;Hampton, I mean?&#8221; said Macloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been here a month&mdash;and that month I&#8217;ve
enjoyed&mdash;thoroughly enjoyed. However, I do miss
the Clubs and their life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can understand,&#8221; Macloud interjected.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the ability to get, instantly, anything you
want&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Much of which you don&#8217;t want&mdash;and wouldn&#8217;t
get, if you had to write for it, or even to walk
down town for it&mdash;which makes for economy,&#8221;
observed Macloud sententiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, more than either, I miss the personal
isolation which one can have in a big town, when
he wishes it&mdash;and has always, in some degree.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And <i>that</i> gets on your nerves!&#8221; laughed Macloud.
&#8220;Well, you won&#8217;t mind it after a while, I
think. You&#8217;ll get used to it, and be quite oblivious.
Is that all your objections?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been here only a short time, remember.
Come back in six months, say, and I may have
kicks in plenty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may find it a bit dreary in winter&mdash;who
the deuce is that girl yonder, Geoffrey?&#8221; he broke
off.</p>
<p>They were opposite Carrington&#8217;s, and down the
walk toward the gate was coming the maid of the
blue-black hair, and slender ankles. She wore a
blue linen gown, a black hat, and her face was
framed by a white silk parasol.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That is Miss Carrington,&#8221; said Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hum!&mdash;Your house near here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;pretty near.&#8221;</p>
<p>Macloud looked at him with a grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;She has nothing to do with your liking the
town, I suppose?&#8221; he said, knowingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she&#8217;s not exactly a deterrent&mdash;and there
are half a dozen more of the same sort. Oh, on
that score, Hampton&#8217;s not half bad, my friend!&#8221;
he laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean there are half a dozen of <i>that</i> sort,&#8221;
with a slight jerk of his head toward Miss Carrington,
&#8220;who are unmarried?&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden nodded&mdash;then looked across; and both
men raised their hats and bowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;And how many married?&#8221; Macloud queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Several&mdash;but you let them <i>alone</i>&mdash;it&#8217;s not
fashionable here, as yet, for a pretty married
woman to have an affair. She loves her husband,
or acts it, at least. They&#8217;re neither prudes nor
prigs, but they are not <i>that</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So far as you know!&#8221; laughed Macloud. &#8220;But
my experience has been that the pretty married
woman who won&#8217;t flirt, if occasion offers where
there is no danger of being compromised, is a
pretty scarce article. However, Hampton may be
an exception.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re too cynical,&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;We turn
in here&mdash;this is Clarendon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why! you beggar!&#8221; Macloud exclaimed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been sympathizing with you, because I
thought you were living in a shack-of-a-place&mdash;and,
behold!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is not bad,&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;I&#8217;ve no
ground for complaint, on that head. I can, at
least, be comfortable here. It&#8217;s not bad inside,
either.&#8221;</p>
<p>That evening, after dinner, when the two men
were sitting in the library while a short-lived
thunder storm raged outside, Macloud, after a
long break in the conversation&mdash;which is the surest
sign of camaraderie among men&mdash;observed, apropos
of nothing except the talk of the morning:</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord! man, you&#8217;ve got no kick coming!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who said I had?&#8221; Croyden demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;You did, by damning it with faint praise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Damning what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your present environment&mdash;and yet, look you!
A comfortable house, fine grounds, beautiful old
furnishings, delicious victuals, and two negro servants,
who are devoted to you, or the place&mdash;no
matter which, for it assures their permanence; the
one a marvelous cook, the other a competent man;
and, by way of society, a lot of fine, old antebellum
families, with daughters like the Symphony
in Blue, we saw this morning. God! you&#8217;re hard
to please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that is not all,&#8221; said Croyden, laughing
and pointing to the portraits. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got ancestors&mdash;by
purchase.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And you have come by them clean-handed,
which is rare.&mdash;Moreover, I fancy you are one
who has them by inheritance, as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden nodded. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad to say I have&mdash;ancestors
are distinctly fashionable down here. But
<i>that&#8217;s</i> not all I&#8217;ve got.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is only one thing more&mdash;money,&#8221; said
Macloud. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t found any of it down
here, have you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is just what I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Croyden
replied, tossing away his cigarette, and crossing
to the desk by the window. &#8220;It depends&mdash;on
this.&#8221; He handed the Parmenter letter to Macloud.
&#8220;Read it through&mdash;the endorsements last, in their
order&mdash;and then tell me what you think of it.&#8221;...</p>
<p>&#8220;These endorsements, I take it,&#8221; said Macloud,
&#8220;though without date and signed only with initials,
were made by the original addressee, Marmaduke
Duval, his son, who was presumably Daniel Duval,
and Daniel Duval&#8217;s son, Marmaduke; the rest, of
course, is plain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is correct,&#8221; Croyden answered. &#8220;I have
made inquiries&mdash;Colonel Duval&#8217;s father was Marmaduke,
whose son was Daniel, whose son was
Marmaduke, the addressee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why isn&#8217;t it true?&#8221; Macloud demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear fellow, I&#8217;m not denying it! I simply
want your opinion&mdash;what to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you shown this letter to anyone else?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No one.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re a fool to show it even to me.
What assurance have you that, when I leave here,
I won&#8217;t go straight to Annapolis and steal your
treasure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No assurance, except a lamblike trust in your
friendship,&#8221; said Croyden, with an amused smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your recent experience with Royster &amp; Axtell
and the Heights should beget confidences of this
kind?&#8221; he said sarcastically, tapping the letter the
while. &#8220;You trust too much in friendship, Croyden.
Tests of half a million dollars aren&#8217;t human!&#8221;
Then he grinned. &#8220;I always thought there was
something God-like about me. So, maybe, you&#8217;re
safe. But it was a fearful risk, man, a fearful
risk!&#8221; He looked at the letter again. &#8220;Sure,
it&#8217;s true! The man to whom it was addressed believed
it&mdash;else why did he endorse it to his son? And
we can assume that Daniel Duval knew his father&#8217;s
writing, and accepted it.&mdash;Oh, it&#8217;s genuine enough.
But to prove it, did you identify Marmaduke
Duval&#8217;s writing&mdash;any papers or old letters in the
house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; returned Croyden. &#8220;I&#8217;ll ask
Moses to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better not arouse his curiosity&mdash;darkies are
most inquisitive, you know&mdash;where did you find the
letter?&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden showed him the secret drawer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another proof of its genuineness,&#8221; said Macloud.
&#8220;Have you made any effort to identify this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
man Parmenter&mdash;from the records at Annapolis.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;I&#8217;ve done nothing but look at the letter&mdash;except
to trace the Duval descent,&#8221; Croyden replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;He speaks, here, of his last will and testament
being left with Mr. Dulany. If it were probated,
that will establish Parmenter, especially if Marmaduke
Duval is the legatee. What do you know of
Annapolis?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing! I never was there&mdash;I looked it up
on the map I found, here, and Greenberry Point is
as the letter says&mdash;across the Severn River from
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Macloud laughed, in good-natured raillery.</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to have been in a devil of a hurry!&#8221;
he said. &#8220;At the same rate of progression, you
will go to Annapolis some time next spring, and get
over to Greenberry Point about autumn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary, it&#8217;s your coming that delayed
me,&#8221; Croyden smiled. &#8220;But for your wire,
I would have started this morning&mdash;now, if you
will accompany me, we&#8217;ll go day-after-to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why delay?&#8221; said Macloud. &#8220;Why not go
to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a long journey around the Bay by rail&mdash;I&#8217;d
rather cross to Baltimore by boat; from there
it&#8217;s only an hour&#8217;s ride to Annapolis by electric
cars. And there isn&#8217;t any boat sailing until day-after-to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the map?&#8221; said Macloud. &#8220;Let me
see where we are, and where Annapolis is....
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
Hum! we&#8217;re almost opposite! Can&#8217;t we get a boat
in the morning to take us across direct&mdash;charter
it, I mean? The Chesapeake isn&#8217;t wide at this
point&mdash;a sailing vessel ought to make it in a few
hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go you!&#8221; exclaimed Croyden. He went to
the telephone and called up Dick. &#8220;This is
Geoffrey Croyden!&#8221; he said.&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;ve a friend who
wants to go across the Bay to Annapolis, in the
morning. Where can I find out if there is a
sailing vessel, or a motor boat, obtainable?...
what&#8217;s that you say?... Miles Casey?&mdash;on Fleet
Street, near the wharf?... Thank you!&mdash;He
says,&#8221; turning to Macloud, &#8220;Casey will likely take
us&mdash;he has a fishing schooner and it is in port.
He lives on Fleet Street&mdash;we will walk down,
presently, and see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Macloud nodded assent, and fell to studying
the directions again. Croyden returned to his chair
and smoked in silence, waiting for his friend to conclude.
At length, the latter folded the letter and
looked up.</p>
<p>&#8220;It oughtn&#8217;t to be hard to find,&#8221; he observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if the trees are still standing, and the
Point is in the same place,&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;But
we&#8217;re going to find the Point shifted about ninety
degrees, and God knows how many feet, while the
trees will have long since disappeared.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or the whole Point may be built over with
houses!&#8221; Macloud responded. &#8220;Why not go the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
whole throw-down at once&mdash;make it impossible to
recover rather than only difficult to locate!&#8221; He
made a gesture of disbelief. &#8220;Do you fancy that
the Duvals didn&#8217;t keep an eye on Greenberry Point?&mdash;that
they wouldn&#8217;t have noted, in their endorsements,
any change in the ground? So it&#8217;s clear,
in my mind, that, when Colonel Duval transferred
this letter to you, the Parmenter treasure could
readily be located.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I shan&#8217;t object, in the least, if we walk
directly to the spot, and hit the box on the third
dig of the pick!&#8221; laughed Croyden. &#8220;But let us
forget the old pirate, until to-morrow; tell me
about Northumberland&mdash;it seems a year since I
left! When one goes away for good and all, it&#8217;s
different, you know, from going away for the
summer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you think you have left it for good and
all?&#8221; asked Macloud, blowing a smoke-ring and
watching him with contemplative eyes&mdash;&#8220;Well, the
place is the same&mdash;only more so. A good many people
have come back. The Heights is more lively than
when you left, teas, and dinners, and tournaments
and such like.&mdash;In town, the Northumberland&#8217;s resuming
its regulars&mdash;the theatres are open, and the
Club has taken the bald-headed row on Monday
nights as usual. Billy Cain has turned up engaged,
also as usual&mdash;this time, it&#8217;s a Richmond girl,
&#8216;regular screamer,&#8217; he says. It will last the allotted
time, of course&mdash;six weeks was the limit for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
last two, you&#8217;ll remember. Smythe put it all over
Little in the tennis tournament, and &#8216;Pud&#8217; Lester
won the golf championship. Terry&#8217;s horse, <i>Peach
Blossom</i>, fell and broke its neck in the high jump,
at the Horse Show; Terry came out easier&mdash;he
broke only his collar-bone. Mattison is the little
bounder he always was&mdash;a month hasn&#8217;t changed
him&mdash;except for the worse. Hungerford is a bit
sillier. Colloden is the same bully fellow; he is
disconsolate, now, because he is beginning to take
on flesh.&#8221; Whereat both laughed. &#8220;Danridge is
back from the North Cape, via Paris, with a new
drink he calls <i>The Spasmodic</i>&mdash;it&#8217;s made of gin,
whiskey, brandy, and absinthe, all in a pint of sarsaparilla.
He says it&#8217;s great&mdash;I&#8217;ve not sampled
it, but judging from those who have he is drawing
it mild.... Betty Whitridge and Nancy Wellesly
have organized a Sinners Class, prerequisites for
membership in which are that you play Bridge on
Sundays and have abstained from church for at
least six months. It&#8217;s limited to twenty. They
filled it the first morning, and have a waiting list
of something over seventy-five.... That is about
all I can think of that&#8217;s new.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has any one inquired about me?&#8221; Croyden
asked&mdash;with the lingering desire one has not to be
forgot.</p>
<p>Macloud shot a questioning glance at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Beyond the fact that the bankruptcy schedules
show you were pretty hard hit, I&#8217;ve heard no one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
comment,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They think you&#8217;re in Europe.
Elaine Cavendish is sponsor for that report&mdash;she
says you told her you were called, suddenly,
abroad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden nodded. Then, after a pause:</p>
<p>&#8220;Any one inclined to play the devoted, there?&#8221;
he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Plenty inclined&mdash;plenty anxious,&#8221; replied Macloud.
&#8220;I&#8217;m looking a bit that way myself&mdash;I may
get into the running, since you are out of it,&#8221; he
added.</p>
<p>Croyden made as though to speak, then bit off
the words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m out of it,&#8221; he said shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re not out of it&mdash;if you find the
pirate&#8217;s treasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait until I find it&mdash;at present, I&#8217;m only an
&#8216;also ran.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who had the field, however, until withdrawn,&#8221;
said Macloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe!&#8221; Croyden laughed. &#8220;But things
have changed with me, Macloud; I&#8217;ve had time for
thought and meditation. I&#8217;m not sure I should
go back to Northumberland, even if the Parmenter
jewels are real. Had I stayed there I suppose I
should have taken my chance with the rest, but
I&#8217;m becoming doubtful, recently, of giving such
hostages to fortune. It&#8217;s all right for a woman to
marry a rich man, but it is a totally different
proposition for a poor man to marry a rich woman.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
Even with the Parmenter treasure, I&#8217;d be poor in
comparison with Elaine Cavendish and her millions&mdash;and
I&#8217;m afraid the sweet bells would soon be
jangling out of tune.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you condemn the girl to spinsterhood,
because there are few men in Northumberland, or
elsewhere, who can match her in wealth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all! I mean, only, that the man should
be able to support her according to her condition
in life.&mdash;In other words, pay all the bills, without
drawing on her fortune.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Those views will never make you the leader of
a popular propaganda!&#8221; said Macloud, with an
amused smile. &#8220;In fact, you&#8217;re alone in the woods.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly! But the views are not irrevocable&mdash;I
may change, you know. In the meantime, let us
go down to Fleet Street and interview Casey. And
then, if you&#8217;re good, I&#8217;ll take you to call on Miss
Carrington.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Symphony in Blue!&#8221; exclaimed Macloud.
&#8220;Come along, man, come along!&#8221;</p>

<h2>VII</h2>
<h3>GREENBERRY POINT</h3>
</div>

<p>There was no trouble with Casey&mdash;he had been
mighty glad to take them. And, at about noon of
the following day, they drew in to the ancient
capital, having made a quick and easy run from
Hampton.</p>
<p>It was clear, bright October weather, when late
summer seems to linger for very joy of staying,
and all nature is in accord. The State House,
where Washington resigned his commission&mdash;with
its chaste lines and dignified white dome, when
viewed from the Bay (where the monstrosity of
recent years that has been hung on behind, is not
visible) stood out clearly in the sunlight, standing
high above the town, which slumbers, in dignified
ease, within its shadow. A few old mansions, up
the Spa, seen before they landed, with the promise
of others concealed among the trees, higher up,
told their story of a Past departed&mdash;a finished
city.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Greenberry Point?&#8221; demanded
Macloud, suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yonder, sir, on the far side of the Severn&mdash;the
strip of land which juts out into the Bay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;First hypothesis, dead as a musket!&#8221; looking
at Croyden. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t a house in sight&mdash;except
the light-house, and it&#8217;s a bug-light.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No houses&mdash;but where are the trees?&#8221; Croyden
returned. &#8220;It seems pretty low,&#8221; he said, to the
skipper; &#8220;is it ever covered with water?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not, sir&mdash;the water&#8217;s just eating it
slowly away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden nodded, and faced townward.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the enormous white stone building,
yonder?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Naval Academy&mdash;that&#8217;s only one of the
buildings, sir, Bancroft Hall. The whole Academy
occupies a great stretch of land along the Severn.&#8221;</p>
<p>They landed at the dock, at the foot of Market
Place and inquired the way to Carvel Hall&mdash;that
being the hotel advised by Dick. They were directed
up Wayman&#8217;s alley&mdash;one of the numerous
three foot thoroughfares between streets, in which
the town abounds&mdash;to Prince George Street, and
turning northward on it for a block, past the once
splendid Brice house, now going slowly to decay,
they arrived at the hotel:&mdash;the central house of
English brick with the wings on either side, and
a modern hotel building tacked on the rear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather attractive!&#8221; was Macloud&#8217;s comment,
as they ascended the steps to the brick terrace
and, thence, into the hotel. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t this an old
residence?&#8221; he inquired of the clerk, behind the
desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir! It&#8217;s the William Paca (the Signer)
mansion, but it served as the home of Dorothy
Manners in <i>Richard Carvel</i>, and hence the name,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
sir: Carvel Hall. We&#8217;ve many fine houses here:
the Chase House&mdash;he also was a Signer; the Harwood
House, said to be one of the most perfect
specimens of Colonial architecture in America; the
Scott House, on the Spa; the Brice House, next
door; McDowell Hall, older than any of them,
was gutted by fire last year, but has been restored;
the Ogle mansion&mdash;he was Governor in the 1740&#8217;s,
I think. Oh! this was the Paris of America before
and during the Revolution. Why, sir, the tonnage
of the Port of Annapolis, in 1770, was greater
than the tonnage of the Port of Baltimore, to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very interesting!&#8221; said Macloud. &#8220;Very interesting,
indeed. What&#8217;s happened to it since
1770?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing, sir&mdash;that&#8217;s the trouble, it&#8217;s progressed
backward&mdash;and Baltimore has taken its
place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see!&#8221; said Macloud, laughing. &#8220;What time
is luncheon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s being served now, sir&mdash;twelve-thirty to
two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Order a pair of saddle horses, and have them
around at one-thirty, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no livery connected with the hotel,
sir, but I&#8217;ll do what I can. There isn&#8217;t any saddlers
for hire, but we will get you a pair of
&#8216;Cheney&#8217;s Best,&#8217; sir&mdash;they&#8217;re sometimes ridden.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
However, you had better drive, if you will permit
me to suggest, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden glanced at Macloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&mdash;we will try the horses,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It had been determined that they should ride
for the reasons, as urged by Macloud, that they
could go on horseback where they could not in a
conveyance, and they would be less likely to occasion
comment. The former of which appealed to
Croyden, though the latter did not.</p>
<p>Macloud had borrowed an extra pair of riding
breeches and puttees, from his friend, and, at the
time appointed, the two men passed through the
office.</p>
<p>&#8220;The horses are waiting, sir!&#8221; the clerk informed
them.</p>
<p>Two negro lads were holding a pair of rawboned
nags, that resembled saddlers about as much
as a cigar-store Indian does a sonata. Croyden
looked them over in undisguised disgust.</p>
<p>&#8220;If these are Cheney&#8217;s Best,&#8221; he commented,
&#8220;what in Heaven&#8217;s name are his worst?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; said Macloud, adjusting the stirrups.
&#8220;Get aboard and leave the kicking to the
horses, they may be better than they look. Where
does one cross the Severn?&#8221; he asked a man who
was passing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Straight up to the College green,&#8221; he replied,
pointing; &#8220;then one square to the right to King
George Street, and on out it, across College Creek,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
to the Marine Barracks. The road forks there;
you turn to the right; and the bridge is at the
foot of the hill.&#8221;</p>
<p>They thanked him, and rode away.</p>
<p>&#8220;He ought to write a guide book,&#8221; said
Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know he hasn&#8217;t?&#8221; Macloud retorted.
&#8220;Well paved streets,&mdash;but a trifle hard
for riding.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And more than a trifle dirty,&#8221; Croyden added.
&#8220;My horse isn&#8217;t so bad&mdash;how&#8217;s yours?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll do!&mdash;This must be the Naval Academy,&#8221;
as they passed along a high brick wall&mdash;&#8220;Yonder,
are the Barracks&mdash;the Marines are drilling in
front.&#8221;</p>
<p>They clattered over the creek, rounded the
quarters of the &#8220;Hermaphrodites,&#8221; and saw below
them the wide bridge, almost a half a mile
long, which spans the Severn. The draw was open,
to let a motor boat pass through, but it closed
before they reached it.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is exceptionally pretty!&#8221; Macloud exclaimed,
drawing rein, midway. &#8220;Look at the high
bluff, on the farther shore, with the view up the
river, on one side, and down the Bay, and clear
across on the other.... Now,&#8221; as they wound up
on the hill, &#8220;for the first road to the right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This doesn&#8217;t look promising!&#8221; laughed
Croyden, as the road swung abruptly westward
and directly away from Greenberry Point.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Let us go a little farther,&#8221; said Macloud.
&#8220;There must be a way&mdash;a bridle path, if nothing
better&mdash;and, if we must, we can push straight
through the timber; there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any
fences. You see, it was rational to ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a wise old owl!&#8221; Croyden retorted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&mdash;there&#8217;s our road!&#8221; as one unexpectedly
took off to the right, among the trees, and bore
almost immediately eastward. &#8220;Come along, my
friend!&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently they were startled by a series of explosions,
a short distance ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are we getting into?&#8221; Macloud exclaimed,
drawing up sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Parmenter&#8217;s defending his treasure!&#8221; said
Croyden, with mock seriousness. &#8220;He is warning
us off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A long way off, then! We must be a mile and
more from the Point. It&#8217;s some one blasting, I
think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t sufficiently muffled,&#8221; Croyden
answered.</p>
<p>They waited a few moments: hearing no further
noises, they proceeded&mdash;a trifle cautiously, however.
A little further on, they came upon a wood cutter.</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t appear at all alarmed,&#8221; Croyden
observed. &#8220;What were the explosions, a minute
ago?&#8221; he called.</p>
<p>&#8220;They weren&#8217;t nothing,&#8221; said the man, leaning
on his axe. &#8220;The Navy&#8217;s got a &#8217;speriment house
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
over here. They&#8217;re trying things. Yer don&#8217;t need
be skeered. If yer goin&#8217; to the station, it&#8217;s just
a little ways, now,&#8221; he added, with the country-man&#8217;s
curiosity&mdash;which they did not satisfy.</p>
<p>They passed the buildings of the Experiment
Station and continued on, amid pine and dogwood,
elms and beeches. They were travelling parallel
with the Severn, and not very distant, as occasional
glimpses of blue water, through the trees,
revealed. Gradually, the timber thinned. The
river became plainly visible with the Bay itself
shimmering to the fore. Then the trees ended abruptly,
and they came out on Greenberry Point: a
long, flat, triangular-shaped piece of ground, possibly
two hundred yards across the base, and three
hundred from base to point.</p>
<p>The two men halted, and looked around.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somewhere near here, possibly just where your
horse is standing, is the treasure,&#8221; said Macloud.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t you feel its presence?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t!&#8221; laughed Croyden, &#8220;and that
appears to be my only chance, for I can&#8217;t see a
trace of the trees which formed the square.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be not cast down!&#8221; Macloud admonished.
&#8220;Remember, you didn&#8217;t expect to find things marked
off for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, <i>I</i> didn&#8217;t! but I thought <i>you</i> did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was only to stir you up. I anticipated
even more adverse conditions. It&#8217;s amazingly easier
than I dared to hope.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Thunder! man! we can&#8217;t dig six feet deep over
all of forty acres. We shall have the whole of
Annapolis over to help us before we&#8217;ve done a
square of forty feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re too liberal!&#8221; laughed Macloud.
&#8220;Twenty feet would be ample.&#8221; Then he sobered.
&#8220;The instructions say: seven hundred and fifty
feet back, from the extreme tip of Greenberry
Point, is the quadrangle of trees. That was in
1720, one hundred and ninety years ago. They
must have been of good size then&mdash;hence, they
would be of the greater size, now, or else have
disappeared entirely. There isn&#8217;t a single tree
which could correspond with Parmenter&#8217;s, closer
than four hundred yards, and, as the point would
have been receding rather than gaining, we can
assume, with tolerable certainty, that the beeches
have vanished&mdash;either from decay or from wind
storms, which must be very severe over in this exposed
land. Hence, must not our first quest be
for some trace of the trees?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds reasonable,&#8221; said Croyden, &#8220;and,
if the Point has receded, which is altogether likely,
then we are pretty near the place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!&mdash;if the Point has simply receded, but if
it has shifted laterally, as well, the problem is not
so simple.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us go out to the Point, and look at the
ruins of the light-house. If we can get near
enough to ascertain when it was built, it may help
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
us. Evidently there was none erected here, in Parmenter&#8217;s
time, else he would not have chosen this
place to hide his treasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the light-house was a barren yield. It was a
crumbling mass of ruins, lying out in water, possibly
fifty feet&mdash;the real house was a bug-light
farther out in the Bay.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s no one to see us, so why shouldn&#8217;t
we make a search for the trees?&#8221; said Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold my horse!&#8221; said Macloud, dismounting.</p>
<p>He went out on the extreme edge, faced about,
and taking a line at right angles to it, stepped two
hundred and fifty paces. He ended in sand&mdash;and,
for another fifty paces, sand&mdash;sand unrelieved by
aught save some low bushes sparsely scattered here
and there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somewhere hereabout, according to present
conditions, the trees should be,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not very promising,&#8221; was Croyden&#8217;s comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us assume that the diagonal lines drawn
between the trees intersect at this point,&#8221; Macloud
continued, producing a compass. &#8220;Then, one
hundred and ten paces North-by-North-East is
the place we seek.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stepped the distance carefully&mdash;Croyden following
with the horses&mdash;and sunk his heel into the
sand beside a clump of wire grass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is the old buccaneer&#8217;s hoard!&#8221; he exclaimed,
dramatically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we dig, immediately?&#8221; Croyden laughed.</p>

HE WENT OUT ON THE EXTREME EDGE, FACED ABOUT, AND STEPPED TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PACES<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You dig&mdash;I&#8217;ll hold the horses; your hands are
tougher than mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder who owns this land?&#8221; said Croyden,
suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can ascertain very readily. You mean, you
would try to purchase it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, as a site for a house, ostensibly. I might
buy a lot beginning, say one hundred and fifty
yards back from the Point, and running, at an
even width of two hundred yards, from the Severn
to the Bay. That would surely include the
treasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A fine idea!&#8221; Macloud agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the present owner will sell,&#8221; appended
Croyden&mdash;&#8220;and if his price isn&#8217;t out of all reason.
I can&#8217;t go much expense, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind the expense&mdash;that can be arranged.
If he will sell, the rest is easy. I&#8217;ll advance it
gladly to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And we will share equally, then,&#8221; said
Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bosh!&#8221; Macloud answered. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got more
money than I want, let me have some fun with the
excess, Croyden. And this promises more fun than
I&#8217;ve had for a year&mdash;hunting a buried treasure,
within sight of Maryland&#8217;s capital. Moreover, it
won&#8217;t likely be out of reach of your own pocketbook,
this can&#8217;t be very valuable land.&#8221; He remounted
his horse. &#8220;Let us ride around over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
the intended site, and prospect&mdash;we may discover
something.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, though, they searched for an hour, they
were utterly unsuccessful. The four beech trees
had disappeared as completely as though they
never were.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m perfectly confident, however,&#8221; Macloud remarked
as they turned away toward town, &#8220;that
somewhere, within the lines of your proposed lot,
lie the Parmenter jewels. Now, for the lot. Once
you have title to it, you may plow up the whole
thing to any depth you please, and no one may
gainsay you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure,&#8221; replied Croyden. &#8220;My knowing
that the treasure was on it when purchased,
may make me liable to my grantor for an accounting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t <i>know</i>!&#8221; objected Macloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet, I have every reason to believe&mdash;the letter
is most specific.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose, after you&#8217;ve paid a big price for
the land, you don&#8217;t find the treasure, could you
make him take it back and refund the purchase
money?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, most assuredly, no,&#8221; smiled Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mighty queer doctrine! You must account for
what you find&mdash;if you don&#8217;t find it, you must keep
the land, anyway. The other fellow wins whatever
happens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s predicated on the proposition that I have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
knowingly deceived him into selling something for
nothing. However, I&#8217;m not at all clear about it;
and we will buy if we can&mdash;and take the chances.
But we won&#8217;t go to work with a brass band, old
man.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the top of the hill, beyond the Severn, there
was a road which took off to the left.</p>
<p>&#8220;This parallels the road by the Marine Barracks,
suppose we turn in here,&#8221; Macloud said. &#8220;It
probably goes through the Academy grounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>A little way on, they passed what was evidently
a fine hospital, with the United States flag flying
over it. Just beyond, occupying the point of land
where College Creek empties into the Severn, was
the Naval Cemetery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very fitting!&#8221; Croyden laughed. &#8220;They have
the place of interment exceedingly handy to the
hospital. What in thunder&#8217;s that?&#8221; he asked, indicating
a huge dome, hideously ornate with gold
and white, that projected above the trees, some
distance ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give it up!&#8221; said Macloud. &#8220;Unless it&#8217;s a
custard-and-cream pudding for the Midshipmen&#8217;s
supper. Awful looking thing, isn&#8217;t it! Oh! I
recollect now: the Government has spent millions
in erecting new Academy buildings; and someone in
the Navy remarked, &#8216;If a certain chap <i>had</i> to kill
somebody, he couldn&#8217;t see why he hadn&#8217;t selected
the fellow who was responsible for them&mdash;his work
at Annapolis would have been ample justification.&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
Judging from the atrocity to our fore, the
officer didn&#8217;t overdraw it.&#8221;</p>
<p>They took the road along the officers&#8217; quarters
on Upshur Row, and came out the upper gate into
King George Street, thereby missing the Chapel
(of the custard-and-cream dome) and all the other
Smith buildings.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can see them again!&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;The
real estate agent is more important now.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the quiet hour when they got back to the
hotel, and the clerk was standing in the doorway,
sunning himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Enjoy your ride, sirs?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t bad,&#8221; returned Croyden. Then he
stopped. &#8220;Can you tell me who owns Greenberry
Point?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir! The Government owns it&mdash;they
bought it for the Rifle Range.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir!&mdash;from the Point clear up to the Experiment
Station.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden thanked him and passed on.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the end of the purchase idea!&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I thought it was &#8217;most too good to last.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It got punctured very early,&#8221; Macloud agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the question is, what to do, now? Might
the clerk be wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>Macloud shook his head. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t a chance
of it. Titles in a small town are known, particularly,
when they&#8217;re in the United States. However,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
it&#8217;s easy to verify&mdash;we&#8217;ll hunt up a real
estate office&mdash;they&#8217;ll know.&#8221;</p>
<p>But when they had dressed, and sought a real
estate office, the last doubt vanished: it confirmed
the clerk.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you haven&#8217;t anything particularly pressing,&#8221;
said Macloud, &#8220;I suggest that we remain here for
a few days and consider what is best to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My most pressing business is to find the
treasure!&#8221; Croyden laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! then we&#8217;re on the job until it&#8217;s found&mdash;if
it takes a year or longer.&#8221; And when Croyden
looked his surprise: &#8220;I&#8217;ve nothing to do, old chap,
and one doesn&#8217;t have the opportunity to go treasure
hunting more than once in a lifetime. Picture our
satisfaction when we hear the pick strike the iron
box, and see the lid turned back, and the jewels
coruscating before us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what if there isn&#8217;t any coruscating&mdash;that&#8217;s
a good word, old man&mdash;nor any iron box?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so pessimistic&mdash;<i>think</i> we&#8217;re going to
find it, it will help a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about if we <i>don&#8217;t</i> find it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, at least, we&#8217;ll have had a good time
in hunting, and have done our best to succeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a new thing to hear old cynical Macloud
preaching optimism!&#8221; laughed Croyden&mdash;&#8220;our
last talk, in Northumberland, wasn&#8217;t particularly
in that line, you&#8217;ll remember.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our talk in Northumberland had to do with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
other people and conditions. This is an adventure,
and has to do solely with ourselves. Some difference,
my dear Croyden, some difference! What
do you say to an early breakfast to-morrow, and
then a walk over to the Point. It&#8217;s something
like your Eastern Shore to get to, however,&mdash;just
across the river by water, but three miles around
by the Severn bridge. We can have the whole
day for prospecting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m under your orders,&#8221; said Croyden.
&#8220;You&#8217;re in charge of this expedition.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had been passing numerous naval officers
in uniform, some well set-up, some slouchy.</p>
<p>&#8220;The uniform surely does show up the man
for what he is,&#8221; said Macloud. &#8220;Look at these
two for instance&mdash;from the stripes on the sleeves,
a Lieutenant-Commander and a Senior Lieutenant.
Did you ever see a real Bowery tough?&mdash;they are
in that class, with just enough veneer to deceive,
for an instant. There, are two others, opposite.
They look like soldiers. Observe the dignity, the
snappy walk, the inherent air of command.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the fault of the system?&#8221; asked
Croyden. &#8220;Every Congressman holds a competitive
examination in his district; and the appointment
goes to the applicant who wins&mdash;be he what he
may. For that reason, I dare say, the Brigade
of Midshipmen contains muckers as well as gentlemen&mdash;and
officers are but midshipmen of a larger
growth.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Just so! and it&#8217;s wrong&mdash;all wrong! To be a
commissioned officer, in either Army or Navy, ought
to attest one&#8217;s gentle birth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It raises a presumption in their favor, at
least.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Presumption! do you think the two who passed
us could hide behind that presumption longer than
the fraction of an instant?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get excited, old man! I was accounting
for it, not defending it. It&#8217;s a pity, of course,
but that&#8217;s one of the misfortunes of a Republic
where all men are equal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rot! damn rot!&#8221; Macloud exclaimed. &#8220;Men
aren&#8217;t equal!&mdash;they&#8217;re born to different social
scales, different intellectualities, different conditions
otherwise. For the purpose of suffrage they may,
in the theory of our government, be equal&mdash;but we
haven&#8217;t yet demonstrated it. We exclude the
Japanese and Chinese. We have included the negro,
only within the living generation&mdash;and it&#8217;s entirely
evident, now, we made a monstrous mistake by doing
it. Equal! Equal! Never in this world!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about the next world?&#8221; asked Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know!&#8221; laughed Macloud, as they
ascended the steps of the hotel. &#8220;For my part, I&#8217;m
for the Moslem&#8217;s Paradise and the Houris who attend
the Faithful. And, speaking of houris!&mdash;see
who&#8217;s here!&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden glanced up&mdash;to see Elaine Cavendish
and Charlotte Brundage standing in the doorway.</p>

<h2>VIII</h2>
<h3>STOLEN</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;This is, truly, a surprise!&#8221; Miss Cavendish
exclaimed. &#8220;Who would ever have thought of
meeting you two in this out-of-the-way place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, too!&#8221; replied Macloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;When did you return, Geoffrey?&#8221; she inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;From abroad?&mdash;I haven&#8217;t gone,&#8221; said Croyden.
&#8220;The business still holds me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him steadily a moment&mdash;Macloud
was talking to Miss Brundage.</p>
<p>&#8220;How much longer will it hold you?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;it&#8217;s
difficult of adjustment.&mdash;What brings you here,
may I inquire?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We were in Washington and came over with
the Westons to the Officers&#8217; Hop to-night&mdash;given
for the Secretary of something. He&#8217;s one of the
Cabinet. We return in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I see,&#8221; he answered; the relief in his voice
would have missed a less acute ear. &#8220;Where are
you going now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To a tea at the Superintendent&#8217;s, when the
Westons join us. Come along!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t acquired the Washington habit,&mdash;yet!&#8221;
he laughed. &#8220;A man at a tea fight! Oh,
no!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then go to the dance with us&mdash;Colin! you&#8217;ll
go, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; said Macloud. &#8220;I&#8217;ll follow your voice
any place. Where shall it be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To the Hop, to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not invited&mdash;if that cuts any figure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll go in our party. Ah! Mrs. Weston,
I&#8217;ve presumed to ask Mr. Macloud and Mr. Croyden
to join our party to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Admiral and I shall be delighted to have
them,&#8221; Mrs. Weston answered&mdash;&#8220;Will they also
go with us to the tea? No? Well, then, to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Macloud and Croyden accompanied them to the
Academy gates, and then returned to the hotel.</p>
<p>In the narrow passage between the news-desk and
the office, they bumped, inadvertently, into two
men. There were mutual excuses, and the men
went on.</p>
<p>An hour or so later, Macloud, having changed
into his evening clothes, came into Croyden&#8217;s room
and found him down on his knees looking under the
bureau, and swearing vigorously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whee!&#8221; he said; &#8220;you <i>are</i> a true pirate&#8217;s
heir! Old Parmenter, himself, couldn&#8217;t do it better.
What&#8217;s the matter&mdash;lose something?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t lose anything!&#8221; said Croyden
sarcastically. &#8220;I&#8217;m saying my prayers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And incidentally searching for this, I suppose?&#8221;
picking up a pearl stud from under the bed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>Croyden took it without a word.</p>
<p>&#8220;And when you&#8217;ve sufficiently recovered your
equanimity,&#8221; Macloud went on, &#8220;you might let me
see the aforesaid Parmenter&#8217;s letter. I want to
cogitate over it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s in my wallet!&#8221; grinding in the stud&mdash;&#8220;my
coat&#8217;s on the chair, yonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t find it!&#8221; said Macloud, searching.
&#8220;What pocket is it in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The inside breast pocket!&#8221; exclaimed Croyden,
ramming the last stud home. &#8220;Where would you
think it is&mdash;in the small change pocket?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then suppose you find it for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it with&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He stopped. &#8220;Do you
mean it isn&#8217;t there?&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t there!&#8221; said Macloud, holding up the
coat.</p>
<p>Croyden&#8217;s fingers flew to the breast pocket&mdash;empty!
to the other pockets&mdash;no wallet! He seized
his trousers; then his waistcoat&mdash;no wallet.</p>
<p>&#8220;My God! I&#8217;ve lost it!&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you left it in Hampton?&#8221; said
Macloud.</p>
<p>Croyden shook his head. &#8220;I had it when we left
the Weston party&mdash;I felt it in my pocket, as I
bent to tie Miss Cavendish&#8217;s shoe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, it oughtn&#8217;t to be difficult to find&mdash;it&#8217;s
lost between the Sampson Gate and the hotel. I&#8217;m
going out to search, possibly in the fading light
it has not been noticed. You telephone the office&mdash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
then join me, as quickly as you can get into
your clothes.&#8221;</p>
<p>He dashed out and down the stairs into the
Exchange, passing midway, with the barest nod,
the Weston party, nor pausing to answer the
question Miss Cavendish flung after him.</p>
<p>Once on the rear piazza, however, he went slowly
down the broad white steps to the broad brick
walk&mdash;the electric lights were on, and he noted,
with keen regret, how bright they made it&mdash;and
thence to the Sampson Gate. It was vain! He
inquired of the guard stationed there, and that,
too, proving unavailing, left directions for its
return, if found.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a misfortune!&#8221; he muttered, as he
renewed the search. &#8220;What a misfortune! If
any one reads that letter, the jig is up for us....
Here! boys,&#8221; to a crowd of noisy urchins, sitting
on the coping along the street, &#8220;do you want to
make a dollar?&#8221;</p>
<p>The enthusiasm of the response, not to mention
its unanimity, threatened dire disaster to Macloud&#8217;s
toilet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t pull me apart.
You all can have a chance for it. I&#8217;ve lost a
wallet&mdash;a pocketbook&mdash;between the gate yonder
and the hotel. A dollar to the boy who finds it.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a shout, they set to work. A moment
later Croyden came down the walk.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t got it,&#8221; Macloud said, answering his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
look. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been over to the gate and back, and
now I&#8217;ve put these gamins to work. They will find
it, if it&#8217;s to be found. Did you telephone the
office?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing doing there!&#8221; Croyden answered.
&#8220;And what&#8217;s more, there won&#8217;t be anything doing
here&mdash;we shall never find the letter, Macloud.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my fear,&#8221; Macloud admitted. &#8220;Somebody&#8217;s
already found it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody&#8217;s <i>stolen</i> it,&#8221; Croyden answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Precisely!&mdash;do you recall our being jostled by
two men in the narrow corridor of the hotel?
Well, then is when I lost my wallet. I am sure
of it. I wasn&#8217;t in a position to drop it from my
pocket.&#8221;</p>
<p>Macloud&#8217;s hand sought his own breast pocket
and stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;I forgot to change, when I dressed. Maybe
the other fellow made off with mine. I&#8217;ll go and
investigate&mdash;you keep an eye on the boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently he returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Mine is missing,
too. We&#8217;ll call off the boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>He flung them some small coins, thereby precipitating
a scramble and a fight, and they went
slowly in.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is just one chance,&#8221; he continued.
&#8220;Pickpockets usually abstract the money, instantly,
and throw the book and papers away.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
They want no tell-tale evidence. It may be the case
here&mdash;they, likely, didn&#8217;t examine the letter, just
saw it <i>was</i> a letter and went no further.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t help us much,&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;It
will be found&mdash;it&#8217;s only a question of the pickpockets
or some one else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the some one else may be honest. Your
card is in the wallet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With Hampton on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The finder may advertise&mdash;may look you up
at the hotel&mdash;may&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May bring it back on a gold salver!&#8221; Croyden
interjected. &#8220;No! No! Colin. Our only hope is
that the thief threw away the letter, and that no
one finds it until after we have the treasure. The
man isn&#8217;t born who, under the circumstances, will
renounce the opportunity for a half million dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, at the worst, we have an even chance!
Thank Heaven! We know the directions without
the letter. Don&#8217;t be discouraged, old man&mdash;we&#8217;ll
win out, yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not discouraged!&#8221; laughed Croyden. &#8220;I
have never anticipated success. It was sport&mdash;an
adventure and a problem to work out, nothing
more. Now, if we have some one else to combat,
so much greater the adventure, and more intricate
the problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we notify the police?&#8221; Macloud asked.
&#8220;Or isn&#8217;t it well to get them into it?&#8221;

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll confess I don&#8217;t know. If we could jug the
thieves quickly, and recover the plunder, it might
be well. On the other hand, they might disclose
the letter to the police or to some pal, or try even
to treat with us, on the threat of publicity. On
the whole, I&#8217;m inclined to secrecy&mdash;and, if the
thieves show up on the Point, to have it out with
them. There are only two, so we shall not be
overmatched. Moreover, we can be sure they will
keep it strictly to themselves, if we don&#8217;t force
their hands by trying to arrest them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Macloud considered a moment. &#8220;I incline to
your opinion. We will simply advertise for the
wallets to-morrow, as a bluff&mdash;and go to work in
earnest to find the treasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had entered the hotel again; in the Exchange,
the rocking chair brigade and the knocker&#8217;s
club were gathered.</p>
<p>&#8220;The usual thing!&#8221; Croyden remarked. &#8220;Why
can&#8217;t a hotel ever be free of them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it&#8217;s a hotel!&#8221; laughed Macloud.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s go in to dinner&mdash;I&#8217;m hungry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tall head-waiter received them like a host
himself, and conducted them down the room to
a small table. A moment later, the Weston party
came in, with Montecute Mattison in tow, and
were shown to one nearby, with Harvey&#8217;s most
impressive manner.</p>
<p>An Admiral is some pumpkins in Annapolis, when
he is on the <i>active</i> list.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></p>
<p>Mrs. Weston and the young ladies looked over
and nodded; Croyden and Macloud arose and
bowed. They saw Miss Cavendish lean toward the
Admiral and say a word. He glanced across.</p>
<p>&#8220;We would be glad to have you join us,&#8221; said
he, with a man&#8217;s fine indifference to the fact that
their table was, already, scarcely large enough for
five.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid we should crowd you, sir. Thank
you!&mdash;we&#8217;ll join you later, if we may,&#8221; replied
Macloud.</p>
<p>A little time after, they heard Mattison&#8217;s irritating
voice, pitched loud enough to reach them:</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what Croyden&#8217;s doing here with
Macloud?&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;I thought you said,
Elaine, that he had skipped for foreign parts,
after the Royster smash, last September.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did say, Mr. Mattison, I <i>thought</i> he had
gone abroad, but I most assuredly did not say, nor
infer, that he had <i>skipped</i>, nor connect his going
with Royster&#8217;s failure!&#8221; Miss Cavendish responded.
&#8220;If you must say unjust and unkind things, don&#8217;t
make other people responsible for them, please.
Shoulder them yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good girl!&#8221; muttered Macloud. &#8220;Hand him
another!&#8221; Then he shot a look at his friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;They may
think what they please&mdash;and Mattison&#8217;s venom is
sprinkled so indiscriminately it doesn&#8217;t hurt.
Everyone comes in for a dose.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>They dallied through dinner, and finished at the
same time as the Westons. Croyden walked out
with Miss Cavendish.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t help overhearing that remark of
Mattison&#8217;s&mdash;the beggar intended that I should,&#8221;
said he&mdash;&#8220;and I want to thank you, Elaine, for
your &#8216;come back&#8217; at him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t come back harder,&#8221; said
she.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if you prefer me not to go with you to
the Hop to-night don&#8217;t hesitate to say so&mdash;I&#8217;ll
understand, perfectly. The Westons may have
got a wrong impression&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Westons haven&#8217;t ridden in the same motor,
from Washington to Annapolis, with Montecute
for nothing; but I&#8217;ll set you straight, never fear.
We are going over in the car&mdash;there is room for
you both, and Mrs. Weston expects you. We will
be down at nine. It&#8217;s the fashion to go early,
here, it seems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zimmerman was swinging his red-coated military
band through a dreamy, sensuous waltz,
as they entered the gymnasium, where the Hops,
at the Naval Academy, are held. The bareness
of the huge room was gone entirely&mdash;concealed
by flags and bunting, which hung in brilliant festoons
from the galleries and the roof. Myriads
of variegated lights flashed back the glitter of
epaulet and the gleam of white shoulders, with,
here and there, the black of the civilian looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
strangely incongruous amid the throng that
danced itself into a very kaleidoscope of color.</p>
<p>The Secretary was a very ordinary man, who
had a place in the Cabinet as a reward for political
deeds done, and to be done. He represented a
State machine, nothing more. Quality, temperament,
fitness, poise had nothing to do with his
selection. His wife was his equivalent, though,
superficially, she appeared to better advantage,
thanks to a Parisian modiste with exquisite taste,
and her fond husband&#8217;s bottomless bank account.</p>
<p>Having passed the receiving line, the Westons
held a small reception of their own. The Admiral
was still upon the active list, with four years of
service ahead of him. He was to be the next Aide
on Personnel, the knowing ones said, and the orders
were being looked for every day. Therefore he
was decidedly a personage to tie to&mdash;more important
even than the Secretary, himself, who was a
mere figurehead in the Department. And the
officers&mdash;and their wives, too, if they were married&mdash;crowded
around the Westons, fairly walking
over one another in their efforts to be noticed.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the meaning of it?&#8221; Croyden asked
Miss Cavendish as they joined the dancing throng.
&#8220;Are the Westons so amazingly popular?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all! they&#8217;re hailing the rising sun,&#8221;
she said&mdash;and explained: &#8220;They would do the
same if he were a mummy or had small-pox.
&#8216;Grease,&#8217; they call it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></p>
<p>(The watchword, in the Navy, is &#8220;grease.&#8221; From
the moment you enter the Academy, as a plebe,
until you have joined the lost souls on the retired
list, you are diligently engaged in greasing every
one who ranks you and in being greased by every
one whom you rank. And the more assiduous and
adroit you are at the greasing business, the more
pleasant the life you lead. The man who ranks
you can, when placed over you, make life a burden
or a pleasure as his fancy and his disposition dictate.
Consequently the &#8220;grease,&#8221; and the higher
the rank the greater the &#8220;grease,&#8221; and the number
of &#8220;greasers.&#8221;)</p>
<p>&#8220;Well-named!&mdash;dirty, smeary, contaminating
business,&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;And the best &#8216;greasers&#8217;
have the best places, I reckon. I prefer the unadorned
garb of the civilian&mdash;and independence.
I&#8217;ll permit those fellows to fight the battles and
draw the rewards&mdash;they can do both very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not get another dance with her until
well toward the end&mdash;and would not then, if the
lieutenant to whom it belonged had not been a
second late&mdash;late enough to lose her.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going back to Washington, in the
morning,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you come along?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Impossible!&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Much as I&#8217;d like
to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up at him, quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure you would like to do it?&#8221; she
asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What a question!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Geoffrey!&mdash;what is this business which keeps
you here&mdash;in the East?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Business!&#8221; he replied, smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which means, I must not ask, I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you tell me one thing&mdash;just one?&#8221; she
persisted. &#8220;Has Royster &amp; Axtell&#8217;s failure anything
to do with it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;it has!&#8221; he said, after a moment&#8217;s hesitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;And is it true that you are seriously embarrassed&mdash;have
lost most of your fortune?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was to be just one question!&#8221; he smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a woman,&#8221; she explained.</p>
<p>They danced half the length of the room before
he replied. He would tell her. She, alone, deserved
to know&mdash;and, if she cared, would understand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have lost most of my fortune!&#8221; he admitted.
&#8220;I am not, however, in the least embarrassed&mdash;I
have no debts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And is it &#8216;business,&#8217; which keeps you?&mdash;will
you ever come back to Northumberland?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is business that keeps me&mdash;important
business. Whether or not I shall return to Northumberland,
depends on the outcome of that
business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you leave without a word of farewell
to your friends?&#8221; she persisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was that unusual?&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;Has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
any of my friends cared&mdash;sincerely cared? Has
any one so much as inquired for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked away.</p>
<p>&#8220;They thought you were called to Europe,
suddenly,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;For which thinking you were responsible,
Elaine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why I?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were the only one I told.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes sought his, then fell.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was because of the failure,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You
were the largest creditor&mdash;you disappeared&mdash;there
were queries and rumors&mdash;and I thought it best
to tell. I hope I did no harm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I am very, very
grateful to know that some one thought of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The music stopped. It was just in time.
Another moment, and he might have said what
he knew was folly. Her body close to his, his
arm around her, the splendor of her bared shoulders,
the perfume of her hair, the glory of her face,
were overcoming him, were intoxicating his senses,
were drugging him into non-resistance. The spell
was broken not an instant too soon. He shook
himself&mdash;like a man rousing from dead sleep&mdash;and
took her back to their party.</p>
<p>The next instant, as she was whirled away by
another, she shot him an alluringly fascinating
smile, of intimate camaraderie, of understanding,
which well-nigh put him to sleep again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I would that I might get such a smile,&#8221; sighed
Macloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;You go to the devil!&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;She
has the same smile for all her friends, so don&#8217;t
be silly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And don&#8217;t be blind!&#8221; Macloud laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moreover, if it&#8217;s a different smile, the field
is open. I&#8217;m scratched, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can a man be scratched <i>after</i> he has won?&#8221;
asked Macloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;More silliness!&#8221; Croyden retorted, as he
turned away to search for his partner.</p>
<p>When the Hop was over, they said good-night
at the foot of the stairs, in the Exchange.</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall see you in the morning, of course&mdash;we
leave about ten o&#8217;clock,&#8221; said Miss Cavendish.</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall be gone long before you are awake,&#8221;
answered Croyden. And, when she looked at him
inquiringly, he added: &#8220;It&#8217;s an appointment that
may not be broken.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, till Northumberland, then!&#8221; Miss
Brundage remarked.</p>
<p>But Elaine Cavendish&#8217;s only reply was a meaning
nod and another fascinating smile. She wished
him success.</p>
<p>As they entered their own rooms, a little later,
Macloud, in the lead, switched on the lights&mdash;and
stopped!</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&mdash;our wallets, by all that&#8217;s good!&#8221; he
exclaimed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; cried Croyden, springing in, and
stumbling over Macloud in his eagerness.</p>
<p>He seized his wallet!&mdash;A touch, and the story
was told. No need to investigate&mdash;it was as empty
as the day it came from the shop, save for a few
visiting cards, and some trifling memoranda. The
letter and the money were gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn!&#8221; said Croyden.</p>
<p>Macloud laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t fancy you would find it?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t, but damn! anyway&mdash;who
wouldn&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re strictly orthodox!&#8221; Macloud
laughed. &#8220;But the pity is that won&#8217;t help us.
They&#8217;ve got old Parmenter&#8217;s letter&mdash;and our ready
cash as well; but the cash does not count.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It counts with me,&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;I&#8217;m out
something over a hundred&mdash;and that&#8217;s considerable
to me now. Anything to show where they were
recovered?&#8221;</p>
<p>Macloud was nearest the telephone. He took
down the receiver. After a time he was answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you know about our wallets?&#8221; he
asked.... &#8220;Thank you!&mdash;The office says, they
were found by one of the bell-boys in a garbage
can on King George Street.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good,&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;If they mean
fight, I reckon we can accommodate them. Greenberry
Point early in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='major' />

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
<h2>IX</h2>
<h3>THE WAY OUT</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking,&#8221; said Croyden, as they
footed it across the Severn bridge, &#8220;that, if we
knew the year in which the light-house was erected,
we could get the average encroachment of the sea
every year, and, by a little figuring, arrive at where
the point was in 1720. It would be approximate,
of course, but it would give us a start&mdash;something
more definite than we have now. For all we know
Parmenter&#8217;s treasure may be a hundred yards out
in the Bay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Macloud nodded. &#8220;And if we don&#8217;t find the
date, here,&#8221; he added, &#8220;we can go to Washington
and get it from the Navy Department. An inquiry
from Senator Rickrose will bring what we want,
instantly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At the same time, why shouldn&#8217;t we get permission
to camp on the Point for a few weeks?&#8221;
Croyden suggested. &#8220;It would make it easy for
us to dig and investigate, and fish and measure,
in fact, do whatever we wished. Having a permit
from the Department, would remove all suspicion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bully! We&#8217;re fond of the open&mdash;with a town
convenient!&#8221; Macloud laughed. &#8220;I know Rickrose
well, we can go down this afternoon and see
him. He will be so astonished that we are not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
seeking a political favor, he will go to the Secretary
himself and make ours a personal request. Then
we will get the necessary camp stuff, and be right
on the job.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had passed the Experiment Station and
the Rifle Range, and were rounding the shoal onto
the Point, when the trotting of a rapidly approaching
horse came to them from the rear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose we conceal ourselves, and take a look,&#8221;
suggested Macloud. &#8220;Here is a fine place.&#8221;</p>
<p>He pointed to some rocks and bushes that lined
the roadway. The next instant, they had disappeared
behind them.</p>
<p>A moment more, and the horse and buggy came
into view. In it were two men&mdash;of medium size,
dressed quietly, with nothing about them to attract
attention, save that the driver had a hook-nose,
and the other was bald, as the removal of his hat,
an instant, showed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thieves!&#8221; whispered Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;I&#8217;ll bet a hundred on it!&#8221; Macloud
answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Greenberry Point seems far off,&#8221; said the
driver&mdash;&#8220;I wonder if we can have taken the wrong
road?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the only one we could take,&#8221; the other
answered, &#8220;so we must be right. I wonder what
that jay&#8217;s doing?&#8221; he added, with a laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cussing himself for&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; The rest was lost in
the noise of the team.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Right, you are!&#8221; said Croyden, lifting himself
from a bed of stones and vines. &#8220;Right, you
are, my friend! And if I had a gun, I&#8217;d give the
Coroner a job with both of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Macloud looked thoughtful.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be most effective,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But
could we carry it off cleanly? The law is embarrassing
if we&#8217;re detected, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not serious?&#8221; said Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never was more so,&#8221; the other answered. &#8220;I&#8217;d
shoot those scoundrels down without a second&#8217;s
hesitation, if I could do it and not be caught.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A trifle unconventional!&#8221; commented Croyden.
&#8220;However, your idea isn&#8217;t half bad; they wouldn&#8217;t
hesitate to do the same to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly! They won&#8217;t hesitate&mdash;and, what&#8217;s
more, they have the nerve to take the chance.
That is the difference between us and them.&#8221;</p>
<p>They waited until they could no longer hear
the horse&#8217;s hoof-falls nor the rumble of the wheels.
Then they started forward, keeping off the road
and taking a course that afforded the protection
of the trees and undergrowth. Presently, they
caught sight of the two men&mdash;out in the open,
their heads together, poring over a paper, presumably
the Parmenter letter.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not as easy finding the treasure, as it
was to pick my pocket!&#8221; chuckled Croyden.
&#8220;There&#8217;s the letter&mdash;and there are the men who
stole it. And we are helpless to interfere, and they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
know it. It&#8217;s about as aggravating as&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He
stopped, for want of a suitable comparison.</p>
<p>Macloud only nodded in acquiescence.</p>
<p>The men finished with the letter. Hook-nose
went on to the Point, and stood looking at the
ruins of the light-house out in the Bay; the other
turned and viewed the trees that were nearest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Much comfort you&#8217;ll get from either,&#8221; muttered
Croyden.</p>
<p>Hook-nose returned, and the two held a prolonged
conversation, each of them gesticulating,
now toward the water, and again toward the timber.
Finally, one went down to the extreme point and
stepped off two hundred and fifty paces inland.
He marked this point with a stone.</p>
<p>Bald-head pointed to the trees, a hundred yards
away, and shook his head. More talk followed.
Then they produced a compass, and ran the additional
distance to the North-east.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dig! damn you, dig!&#8221; exclaimed Macloud.
&#8220;The treasure&#8217;s not there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to work your brain a bit,&#8221; Croyden
added. &#8220;The letter&#8217;s not all that&#8217;s needed, thank
Heaven! You&#8217;ve stolen the one, but you can&#8217;t
steal the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>The men, after consulting together, went to the
buggy, took out two picks and shovels, and, returning
to the place, fell to work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever see such fools?&#8221; said Macloud.
&#8220;Dig! damn you, dig!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>After a short while, Bald-head threw down his
pick and hoisted himself out of the hole. An
animated discussion followed.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got a glimmer of intelligence, at last,&#8221;
Croyden muttered.</p>
<p>The discussion grew more animated, they waved
their arms toward the Bay, and toward the Severn,
and toward the land. Hook-nose slammed his pick
up and down to emphasize his argument. Bald-head
did likewise.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be doing the war dance, next!&#8221; laughed
Macloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;When thieves fall out, honest men come by
their own,&#8217;&#8221; Croyden quoted.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>More</i> honest men, you mean&mdash;the comparative
degree.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Life is made up of comparatives,&#8221; said Croyden.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter now?&#8221; as Bald-head faced
about and stalked back to the buggy. &#8220;Has he
quit work so soon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has simply quit digging a hole at random,&#8221;
Macloud said. &#8220;My Lord, he&#8217;s taking a drink!&#8221;</p>
<p>Bald-head, however, did not return to his companion.
Instead, he went out to the Bay and stood
looking across the water toward the bug-light.
Then he turned and looked back toward the timber.</p>
<p>He was thinking, as they had. The land had
been driving inward by the encroachment of the
Bay&mdash;the beeches had, long since, disappeared, the
victims of the gales which swept the Point. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
was no place from which to start the measurements.
Beyond the fact that, somewhere near
by, old Parmenter had buried his treasure, one
hundred and ninety years before, the letter was
of no definite use to anyone.</p>
<p>From the Point, he retraced his steps leisurely
to his companion, who had continued digging,
said something&mdash;to which Hook-nose seemingly
made no reply, save by a shovel of sand&mdash;and continued
directly toward the timber.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has he seen us?&#8221; said Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not&mdash;these bushes are ample protection.
Lie low.... He&#8217;s not coming this way&mdash;he&#8217;s going
to inspect the big trees, on our left.... They won&#8217;t
help you, my light-fingered friend; they&#8217;re not the
right sort.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a time, Bald-head abandoned the search
and went back to his friend. Throwing himself
on the ground, he talked vigorously, and, apparently,
to some effect, for, presently, the digging
ceased and Hook-nose began to listen. At length,
he tossed the pick and shovel aside, and lifted
himself out of the hole. After a few more gesticulations,
they picked up the tools and returned
to the buggy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have they decided to abandon it?&#8221; said
Croyden, as they drove away.</p>
<p>The thieves, themselves, answered the question.
At the first heavy undergrowth, they stopped the
horse and proceeded carefully to conceal the tools.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
This accomplished, they drove off toward the town.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hum!&#8221; said Macloud. &#8220;So you&#8217;re coming
back are you? I wonder what you intend to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish we knew,&#8221; Croyden returned. &#8220;It
might help us&mdash;for quite between ourselves, Macloud,
I think we&#8217;re stumped.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our first business is to move on Washington
and get the permit,&#8221; Macloud returned. &#8220;Hook-nose
and his friend may have the Point, for to-day;
they&#8217;re not likely to injure it. Come along!&#8221;</p>
<p>They were passing the Marine Barracks when
Croyden, who had been pondering over the matter,
suddenly broke out:</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to get rid of those two fellows,
Colin!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Granted!&#8221; said Macloud. &#8220;But how are we
to manage it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We agree that we dare not have them arrested&mdash;they
would blow everything to the police. And
the police would either graft us for all the jewels
are worth, or inform the Government.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but we may have to take the risk&mdash;or
else divide up with the thieves. Which do you
prefer to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither!&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;There is another
way&mdash;except killing them, which, of course, would
be the most effective. Why shouldn&#8217;t we imprison
them&mdash;be our own jailers?&#8221;</p>
<p>Macloud threw away his cigarette and lit
another before he replied, then he shook his head.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Too much risk to ourselves,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Somebody
would likely be killed in the operation, with
the chances strongly favoring ourselves. I&#8217;d rather
shoot them down from ambush, at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That may require an explanation to a judge
and jury, which would be a trifle inconvenient. I&#8217;d
prefer to risk my life in a fight. Then, if it came
to court, our reputation is good, while theirs is
in the rogues&#8217; gallery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where would you imprison them?&#8221; asked Macloud,
dubiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the difficulty, I admit. Think over it,
while we&#8217;re going to Washington and back; see if
you can&#8217;t find a way out. Either we must jug
them, securely, for a week or two, or we must
arrest them. On the whole, it might be wiser to
let them go free&mdash;let them make a try for the
treasure, unmolested. When they fail and retire,
we can begin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your last alternative doesn&#8217;t sound particularly
attractive to me&mdash;or to you, either, I fancy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t going to be a particularly attractive
quest, if we want to succeed,&#8221; said Croyden.
&#8220;Pirate&#8217;s gold breeds pirate&#8217;s ways, I reckon&mdash;blood
and violence and sudden death. We&#8217;ll try to
play it without death, however, if our opponents
will permit. Such title, as exists to Parmenter&#8217;s
hoard, is in me, and I am not minded to relinquish
it without a struggle. I wasn&#8217;t especially keen at
the start, but I&#8217;m keen enough, now&mdash;and I don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
propose to be blocked by two rogues, if there is a
way out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the way out, according to your notion,
is to be our own jailers, think you?&#8221; said Macloud.
&#8220;Well, we can chew on it&mdash;the manner of procedure
is apt to keep us occupied a few hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>They took the next train, on the Electric Line,
to Washington, Macloud having telephoned ahead
and made an appointment with Senator Rickrose&mdash;whom,
luckily, they found at the Capital&mdash;to meet
them at the Metropolitan Club for luncheon. At
Fourteenth Street, they changed to a Connecticut
Avenue car, and, dismounting at Seventeenth and
dodging a couple of automobiles, entered the Pompeian
brick and granite building, the home of the
Club which has the most representative membership
in the country.</p>
<p>Macloud was on the non-resident list, and the
door-man, with the memory for faces which comes
from long practice, greeted him, instantly, by
name, though he had not seen him for months.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Macloud, Senator Rickrose just came
in,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>They met the Senator in the Red Room. He
was very tall, with a tendency to corpulency, which,
however, was lost in his great height; very dignified,
and, for one of his service, very young&mdash;of
immense influence in the councils of his party, and
the absolute dictator in his own State. Inheriting
a superb machine from a &#8220;matchless leader,&#8221;&mdash;who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
died in the harness&mdash;he had developed it into a well
nigh perfect organization for political control. All
power was in his hands, from the lowest to the
highest, he ruled with a sway as absolute as a
despot. His word was the ultimate law&mdash;from
it an appeal did not lie.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you, old fellow?&#8221; he said to Macloud,
dropping a hand on his shoulder. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t
seen you for a long time&mdash;and, Mr. Croyden, I
think I have met you in Northumberland. I&#8217;m
glad, indeed, to see you both.&#8221; He touched a bell.
&#8220;Take the orders!&#8221; he said, to the boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Senator!&#8221; said Macloud, a little later, when
they had finished luncheon. &#8220;I want to ask a slight
favor&mdash;not political however&mdash;so it won&#8217;t have to
be endorsed by the organization.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Senator laughed. &#8220;In that event, it is
granted before you ask. What is it I can do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have the Secretary of the Navy issue us a
permit to camp on Greenberry Point.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where the devil is Greenberry Point?&#8221; said
Rickrose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Across the Severn River from Annapolis.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rickrose turned in his chair and glanced over
the dining-room. Then he raised his hand to the
head waiter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has the Secretary of the Navy had luncheon?&#8221;
he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir&mdash;before you came in.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Senator nodded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We would better go over to the Department, at
once, or we shall miss him,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Chevy
Chase is the drawing card, in the afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reception hour was long passed, but the
Secretary was in and would see Senator Rickrose.
He came forward to meet him&mdash;a tall, middle-aged,
well-groomed man, with sandy hair, whose principal
recommendation for the post he filled was the fact
that he was the largest contributor to the campaign
fund in his State, and his senior senator needed
him in his business, and had refrigerated him into
the Cabinet for safe keeping&mdash;that being the only
job which insured him from being a candidate for
the Senator&#8217;s own seat. It is a great game, is
politics!</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Secretary!&#8221; said Rickrose, &#8220;my friends
want a permit to camp for two weeks on Greenberry
Point.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Greenbury Point!&#8221; said the Secretary, vaguely&mdash;&#8220;that&#8217;s
somewhere out in San Francisco
harbor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not the Greenberry Point they mean,&#8221; the
Senator replied. &#8220;It&#8217;s down at Annapolis&mdash;across
the Severn from the Naval Academy, and forms
part of that command, I presume. It is waste
land, unfortified and wind swept.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! to be sure. I know it. Why wouldn&#8217;t
the Superintendent give you a permit?&#8221; turning
to Macloud. &#8220;It is within his jurisdiction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t think to ask him,&#8221; said Macloud.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
&#8220;We supposed it was necessary to apply direct
to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are not familiar with the customs of
the service,&#8221; explained Rickrose, &#8220;and, as I may
run down to see them, just issue the permit to me
and party. The Chairman of the Naval Affairs
Committee is inspecting the Point, if you need
an excuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! none whatever&mdash;however, a duplicate
will be forwarded to the Superintendent. If it
should prove incompatible with the interests of
the service,&#8221; smiling, &#8220;he will inform the Department,
and we shall have to revoke it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rang for his stenographer and dictated the
permit. When it came in, he signed it and passed
it over to Rickrose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything else I can do for you, Senator?&#8221;
he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to-day, thank you, Mr. Secretary,&#8221; Rickrose
answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you actually intend to come down?&#8221; asked
Macloud, when they were in the corridor. &#8220;That
will be bully.&#8221;</p>
<p>He shot a look at Croyden. His face was a
study. Hunting the Parmenter treasure, with the
Chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee as a
disinterested spectator, was rather startling, to say
the least. The Senator&#8217;s reply reassured them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Impossible!&#8221; he said. &#8220;The campaign opens
next week, and I&#8217;m drawn as a spell-binder in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
the Pacific States. That figurehead was ruffling
his feathers on you, just to show himself, so I
thought I&#8217;d comb him down a bit. You&#8217;ll experience
no difficulty, I fancy. If you do, wire
me, and I&#8217;ll get busy. I&#8217;ve got to go over to the
State Department now, so I&#8217;ll say good-bye&mdash;anything
else you want let me know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Next for a sporting goods shop,&#8221; said Macloud
as they went down the steps into Pennsylvania
Avenue; &#8220;for a supply of small arms and ammunition&mdash;and,
incidentally, a couple of tents. We
can get a few cooking utensils in Annapolis, but
we will take our meals at Carvel Hall. I think
neither of us is quite ready to turn cook.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure, I&#8217;m content!&#8221; laughed Croyden.
&#8220;We can hire a horse and buggy by the week,
and keep them handy&mdash;better get a small tent for
the horse, while we&#8217;re about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>They went to a shop on F Street, where they
purchased three tents of suitable size, two Winchester
rifles, and a pair of Colt&#8217;s military revolvers
with six-and-a-half inch barrels, and the necessary
ammunition. These they directed should be sent
to Annapolis immediately. Cots and blankets could
be procured there, with whatever else was necessary.</p>
<p>They were bound up F Street, toward the
Electric Station, when Macloud broke out.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we had another man with us, your imprisonment
idea would not be so difficult&mdash;we could bag
our game much more easily, and guard them more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
securely when we had them. As it is, it&#8217;s mighty
puzzling to arrange.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True enough!&#8221; said Croyden, &#8220;but where is
the man who is trustworthy&mdash;not to mention willing
to take the risk, of being killed or tried for murder,
for someone else&#8217;s benefit? They&#8217;re not many like
you, Colin.&#8221;</p>
<p>A man, who was looking listlessly in a window
just ahead, turned away. He bore an air of dejection,
and his clothes, while well cut, were beginning
to show hard usage and carelessness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Axtell!&#8221; Macloud observed&mdash;&#8220;and on his
uppers!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s our man!&#8221; exclaimed Croyden. &#8220;He
is down hard, a little money with a small divide,
if successful, will get him. What do you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing!&#8221; replied Macloud. &#8220;It&#8217;s up to
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Axtell saw them; he hesitated, whether to speak
or to go on. Croyden solved the question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello! Axtell, what are you doing here?&#8221;
he said, extending his hand.</p>
<p>Axtell grasped it, as a drowning man a straw.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re kind to ask, Mr. Croyden! Mighty kind
in one who lost so much through us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were not to blame&mdash;Royster&#8217;s responsible,
and he&#8217;s gone&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To hell!&#8221; Axtell interrupted, bitterly.
&#8220;May he burn forever!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Amen to that wish!&#8221; Croyden smiled. &#8220;Meanwhile,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
can I do anything for you? You&#8217;re having
a run of hard luck, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment, Axtell did not answer&mdash;he was
gulping down his thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve just ten dollars to my
name. I came here thinking the Congressmen, who
made piles through our office, would get me something,
but they gave me the marble stare. I was
good enough to tip them off and do favors for
them, but they&#8217;re not remembering me now. Do
you know where I can get a job?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;I&#8217;ll give you fifty dollars and board, if
you will come with us for two weeks. Will you
take it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will I take it?&mdash;Well, rather!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you&#8217;re to do, with Mr. Macloud and
myself, we will disclose later. If, then, you don&#8217;t
care to aid us, we must ask you to keep silence
about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to know anything!&#8221; said Axtell.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my part, and ask no questions&mdash;and thank
you for trusting me. You&#8217;re the first man since
our failure, who hasn&#8217;t hit me in the face&mdash;don&#8217;t
you think I appreciate it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good!&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;Have you any
other baggage?&#8221; nodding toward a small bag,
which Axtell had in his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, come along&mdash;we&#8217;re bound for Annapolis,
and the car leaves in ten minutes.&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p>That evening, in the seclusion of their apartment
at Carvel Hall, they took Axtell into their
confidence&mdash;to a certain extent (though, again, he
protested his willingness simply to obey orders).
They told him, in a general way, of Parmenter&#8217;s
bequest, and how Croyden came to be the legatee&mdash;saying
nothing of its great value, however&mdash;its
location, the loss of the letter the previous evening,
the episode of the thieves on the Point, that morning,
and their evident intention to return to the
quest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, what we want to know is: are you ready
to help us&mdash;unaided by the law&mdash;to seize these men
and hold them prisoners, while we search for the
treasure?&#8221; Croyden asked. &#8220;We may be killed
in the attempt, or we may kill one or both of them,
and have to stand trial if detected. If you don&#8217;t
want to take the risk, you have only to decline&mdash;and
hold your tongue.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Mr. Croyden!&#8221; said Axtell, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
want you to pay me a cent&mdash;just give me my board
and lodging and I&#8217;ll gladly aid you as long as
necessary. It&#8217;s a very little thing to do for one
who has lost so much through us. You provide
for our defense, if we&#8217;re apprehended by the law,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
and <i>that</i>&#8221; (snapping his fingers) &#8220;for the risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden held out his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll shake hands on that, Axtell, if you
please,&#8221; he said; &#8220;and, if we recover what Parmenter
buried, you&#8217;ll not regret it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The following morning saw them down at the
Point with the equipage and other paraphernalia.
The men, whom they had brought from Annapolis
for the purpose, pitched the tents under the trees,
ditched them, received their pay, climbed into the
wagons and rumbled away to town&mdash;puzzled that
anyone should want to camp on Greenberry Point
when they had the price of a hotel, and three
square meals a day.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks pretty good,&#8221; said Croyden, when the
canvases were up and everything arranged&mdash;&#8220;and
we shan&#8217;t lack for the beautiful in nature. This
is about the prettiest spot I&#8217;ve ever seen, the
Chesapeake and the broad river&mdash;the old town and
the Academy buildings&mdash;the warships at anchor&mdash;the
<i>tout ensemble!</i> We may not find the treasure,
but, at least, we&#8217;ve got a fine camp&mdash;though, I
reckon, it is a bit breezy when the wind is from
the Bay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if we should have paid our respects
to the Superintendent before poaching on his preserves?&#8221;
said Macloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hum&mdash;hadn&#8217;t thought of that!&#8221; Croyden
answered. &#8220;Better go in and show ourselves to
him, this afternoon. He seems to be something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
of a personage down here, and we don&#8217;t want to
offend him. These naval officers, I&#8217;m told, are
sticklers for dignity and the prerogatives due their
rank.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on!&#8221; exclaimed Macloud. &#8220;On that
score, we&#8217;ve got some rank ourselves to uphold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; said Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly! the Chairman of the Committee on
Naval Affairs, of the United States Senate, is with
us. According to the regulations, is it his duty
to call <i>first</i> on the Superintendent?&mdash;that&#8217;s the
point.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give it up!&#8221; laughed Croyden. &#8220;However,
the Superintendent has a copy of the letter, and
he will know the ropes. We will wait a day, then,
if he&#8217;s quiescent, it&#8217;s up to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Great head!&#8221; laughed Macloud. &#8220;You
should have been a diplomat, Croyden&mdash;nothing
less than an Ambassadorship for you, my boy!&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;A motor boat would be mighty convenient to
go back and forth to Annapolis,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Look
at the one cutting through the water there, midway
across!&#8221;</p>
<p>It came nearer, halted a little way off in deep
water, and an officer in uniform swept the tents
and them with a glass. Then the boat put about
and went chugging upstream.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t seem to please him,&#8221; remarked Macloud,
gazing after the boat. Suddenly it turned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
in toward shore and made the landing at the Experiment
Station.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are about to be welcomed or else ordered
off&mdash;I&#8217;ll take a bet either way,&#8221; said Macloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcomed!&#8221; Croyden responded. &#8220;Otherwise,
they wouldn&#8217;t have despatched an officer&mdash;it would
have been a file of marines instead. You haven&#8217;t
lost the permit, Macloud!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem very sure!&#8221; Macloud laughed.</p>
<p>Presently, the officer appeared, walking rapidly
down the roadway. As soon as he sighted the
tents, he swung over toward them. Macloud went
a few steps forward to meet him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this Senator Rickrose?&#8221; the Lieutenant inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Macloud. &#8220;Senator Rickrose isn&#8217;t
coming until later. I am one of his friends, Colin
Macloud, and this is Mr. Croyden and Mr. Axtell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very glad to meet you, gentlemen!&#8221; said the
Lieutenant. &#8220;The Superintendent presents his
compliments and desires to place himself and the
Academy at your disposal.&#8221; (He was instructed
to add, that Captain Boswick would pay his respects
to-morrow, having been called to Washington
to-day by an unexpected wire, but the absence
of the Chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee
rendered it unnecessary.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank Captain Boswick, for Senator Rickrose
and us, and tell him we appreciate his kindness
exceedingly,&#8221; Macloud answered. &#8220;We&#8217;re camping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
here for a week or so, to try sleeping in the
open, under sea air. We&#8217;re not likely to prove
troublesome!&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Then they took several drinks, and the aide departed.</p>
<p>&#8220;So far, we&#8217;re making delightful progress,&#8221; said
Croyden; &#8220;but there are breakers ahead when
Hook-nose and his partner get in the game. Suppose
we inspect the premises and see if they have
been here in our absence.&#8221;</p>
<p>They went first to the place where they had seen
them conceal the tools&mdash;these were gone; proof
that the thieves had paid a second visit to the
Point. But, search as they might, no evidence of
work was disclosed.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does it mean?&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;Have
they abandoned the quest?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not very likely,&#8221; replied Macloud, &#8220;with half
a million at stake. They probably are seeking information;
when they have it, we shall see them
back again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose they bring four or five others to help
them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t&mdash;never fear!&mdash;they&#8217;re not sharing
the treasure with any one else. Rather, they will
knife each other for it. Honor among thieves is
like the Ph&oelig;nix&mdash;it doesn&#8217;t exist.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If the knifing business were to occur before
the finding, it would help some!&#8221; laughed Croyden.
&#8220;Meantime, I&#8217;m going to look at the ruins of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
light-house. I discovered in an almanac I found
in the hotel last night, that the original light-house
was erected on Greenberry Point in 1818.
This fact may help us a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>They went out to the extreme edge, and stood
gazing across the shoals toward the ruins.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you make the distance from the
land?&#8221; Croyden asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;About one hundred yards&mdash;but it&#8217;s very difficult
to estimate over water. It may be two hundred
for all I can tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is exactly three hundred and twenty-two
feet from the Point to the near side of the ruins,&#8221;
said Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not three hundred and twenty-two and
a half feet!&#8221; scoffed Macloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;I measured it this morning while you were
dawdling over your breakfast,&#8221; answered Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hitched a line to the land and waded out, I
suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly; I measured it on the Government
map of the Harbor. It gives the distance as three
hundred and twenty-two feet, in plain figures.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I said you had a great head!&#8221; Macloud exclaimed.
&#8220;Now, what&#8217;s the rest of the figures&mdash;or
haven&#8217;t you worked it out?&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden drew out a paper. &#8220;The calculation
is of value only on the assumption&mdash;which, however,
is altogether reasonable&mdash;that the light-house,
when erected, stood on the tip of the Point. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
is now three hundred and twenty-two feet in water.
Therefore, dividing ninety-two&mdash;the number of
years since erection&mdash;into three hundred and twenty-two,
gives the average yearly encroachment of the
Bay as three and a half feet. Parmenter buried
the casket in 1720, just a hundred and ninety years
ago; so, multiplying a hundred and ninety by
three and a half feet gives six hundred and sixty-five
feet. In other words, the Point, in 1720, projected
six hundred and sixty-five feet further out
in the Bay than it does to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, with the point moved in six hundred and
sixty-five feet Parmenter&#8217;s beeches should be only
eighty-five feet from the shore line, instead of seven
hundred and fifty!&#8221; Macloud reflected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so!&#8221; said Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;But where are the beeches?&#8221; asked Axtell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Disappeared!&#8221; Croyden replied. &#8220;As the
Point from year to year slipped into the Bay, the
fierce gales, which sweep up the Chesapeake, gradually
ate into the timber. It is seventy years, at
least, since Parmenter&#8217;s beeches went down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t the Duvals have noticed the
encroachment of the Bay, and made a note of it
on the letter?&#8221; Macloud asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably, because it was so gradual they did
not observe it. They, likely, came to Annapolis
only occasionally, and Greenberry Point seemed unchanged&mdash;always
the same narrow stretch of sand,
with large trees to landward.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>Macloud nodded. &#8220;I reckon that&#8217;s reasonable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Next let us measure back eighty-five feet,&#8221;
said Croyden, producing a tape-line.... &#8220;There!
this is where the beech tree should stand. But
where were the other trees, and where did the two
lines drawn from them intersect?&#8221;...</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, now you have it!&#8221; said Macloud&mdash;&#8220;where
were the trees, and where did the lines
intersect? I reckon you&#8217;re stumped.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us try some more assuming. You had a
compass yesterday, still got it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Macloud drew it out and tossed it over.</p>
<p>&#8220;I took the trouble to make a number of diagrams
last night, and they disclosed a peculiar
thing. With the location of the first tree fixed, it
matters little where the others were, in determining
the direction of the treasure. It is practically
the same. The <i>objective point</i> will change as you
change the position of the trees, but the <i>direction</i>
will vary scarcely at all. It is self-evident, of
course, to those who understand such things, but
it was a valuable find for me. Now, if we are correct
in our assumption, thus far, the treasure is
buried&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He opened the compass, and having brought
North under the needle, ran his eye North-by-North-east.
A queer look passed over his face,
then he glanced at Macloud and smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;The treasure is buried,&#8221; he repeated&mdash;&#8220;the
treasure is buried&mdash;<i>out in the Bay</i>.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>Macloud laughed!</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks as if wading would be a bit difficult,&#8221;
he said dryly.</p>
<p>Croyden produced the tape-line again, and they
measured to the low bluff at the water&#8217;s edge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two hundred and eighty-two feet to here,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;and Parmenter buried the treasure at
three hundred and thirty feet&mdash;therefore, it&#8217;s
forty-eight feet out in the Bay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then your supposition is that, since Parmenter&#8217;s
time, the Bay has not only encroached on
the Point, but also has eaten in on the sides.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would seem so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to dig in water,&#8221; Macloud remarked.
&#8220;It&#8217;s apt to fill in the hole, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be sarcastic,&#8221; Croyden retorted. &#8220;I&#8217;m
not responsible for the Bay, nor the Point, nor
Parmenter, nor anything else connected with the
fool quest, please remember.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Except the present measurements and the
theory on which they&#8217;re based,&#8221; Macloud replied.
&#8220;And as the former seem to be accurate, and the
latter more than reasonable, we&#8217;d best act on them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At least, I am satisfied that the treasure lies
either in the Bay, or close on shore; if so, we
have relieved ourselves from digging up the entire
Point.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have given us a mighty plausible start,&#8221;
said Macloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Land or water?&#8221; Croyden laughed. &#8220;Hello,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
whom have we here?&#8221; as a buggy emerged from
among the timber, circled around, and halted before
the tents.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is Hook-nose back again,&#8221; said Macloud.
&#8220;Come to pay a social call, I suppose! Anything
about for them to steal?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing but the shooting-irons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re safe&mdash;I put them under the blankets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What the devil do they want?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to treat with us&mdash;to share the treasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hum! they&#8217;ve got their nerve!&#8221; exclaimed
Croyden.</p>
<p>By this time, they had been observed by the
men in the buggy who, immediately, came toward
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us get away from this place!&#8221; said
Croyden, and they sauntered along landward.</p>
<p>&#8220;And make them stop us&mdash;don&#8217;t give the least
indication that we know them,&#8221; added Macloud.</p>
<p>As the buggy neared, Macloud and Croyden
glanced carelessly at the occupants, and were about
to pass on, when Hook-nose calmly drew the horse
over in front of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which of you men is named Croyden?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; said Geoffrey.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re the man we&#8217;re lookin&#8217; for.
Geoffrey is the rest of your handle, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have the advantage of me,&#8221; Croyden
assured him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I think I have, in more ways than your
name. Where can we have a little private talk?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t!&#8221; said Croyden, stepping quickly
around the horse and continuing on his way&mdash;Macloud
and Axtell following.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d rather have it before your friends,
I&#8217;m perfectly ready to accommodate you,&#8221; said the
fellow. &#8220;I thought, however, you&#8217;d rather keep
the little secret. Well, we&#8217;ll be waiting for you
at the tents, all right, my friend!&#8221; and he drove
ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Macloud, we are going to bag those fellows
right now&mdash;and easy, too,&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;When
we get to the tents, I&#8217;ll take them into one&mdash;and
give them a chance to talk. When you and Axtell
have the revolvers, with one for me, you can join
us. They are armed, of course, but only with
small pistols, likely, and you should have the drop
on them before they can draw. Come, at any
time&mdash;I&#8217;ll let down the tent flaps on the plea of
secrecy (since they&#8217;ve suggested it), so you can
approach with impunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is where <i>we</i> get killed, Axtell!&#8221; said
Macloud. &#8220;I would that I were in my happy home,
or any old place but here. But I&#8217;ve enlisted for
the war, so here goes! If you think it will do
any good to pray, we can just as well wait until
you&#8217;ve put up a few. I&#8217;m not much in that line,
myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Imagine a broker praying!&#8221; laughed Axtell.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; said Macloud. &#8220;But there seem to
be no rules to the game we&#8217;re playing, so I wanted
to give you the opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they approached the tents, Hook-nose passed
the reins to Bald-head and got out.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s to do now?&#8221; asked Macloud. &#8220;They&#8217;re
separated.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave it to me, I&#8217;ll get them together,&#8221; Croyden
answered.... &#8220;You wish to see me, privately?&#8221;
to Hook-nose.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to see you&mdash;it&#8217;s up to you whether to
make it private or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along!&#8221; said Croyden, leading the way
toward the tent, which was pitched a trifle to one
side.... &#8220;Now, sir, what is it?&#8221; as the flaps
dropped behind them.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve a business way about you, which I
like&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began Hook-nose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind my ways!&#8221; Croyden interrupted.
&#8220;Come to the point&mdash;what do you want?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no false starts with you, my friend,
are there!&#8221; laughed the other. &#8220;That&#8217;s the thing&mdash;bang!
and we are off. Good!&mdash;we&#8217;ll get to business.
You lost a letter recently&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; Croyden cut in. &#8220;I had a letter
<i>stolen</i>&mdash;you, I suppose, are the thief.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I, or my pal&mdash;it matters not which,&#8221; the fellow
replied easily. &#8220;Now, what we want, is to
make some arrangement as to the division of the
treasure, when you&#8217;ve found it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I thought as much!&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;Well,
let me tell you there won&#8217;t be any arrangement
made with you, alone. You must get your pal
here&mdash;I don&#8217;t agree with one. I agree with both
or none.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, very well, I&#8217;ll have him in, if you wish.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden bowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do wish,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Hook-nose went to the front of the tent and
raised the flap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bill!&#8221; he called, &#8220;hitch the horse and come
in.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Macloud and Axtell heard and understood.</p>
<p>While Hook-nose was summoning his partner,
Croyden very naturally retired to the rear of the
tent, thus obliging the rogues to keep their backs
to the entrance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Smith, this is Mr. Croyden!&#8221; said Hook-nose.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to make your acquaint&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began
Smith.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no need for an introduction,&#8221; Croyden
interrupted curtly. &#8220;You&#8217;re thieves, by profession,
and blackmailers, in addition. Get down to business,
if you please!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not overly polite, my friend&mdash;but we&#8217;ll
pass that by. You&#8217;re hell for business, and that&#8217;s
our style. You understand, I see, that this treasure
hunt has got to be kept quiet. If anyone peaches,
the Government&#8217;s wise and Parmenter&#8217;s chest is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
dumped into its strong box&mdash;that is, as much as
is left after the officials get their own flippers out.
Now, my idea is for you people to do the searching,
and, when the jewels is found, me and Bill will
take half and youn&#8217;s half. Then we all can knock
off work, and live respectable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather a good bargain for you,&#8221; said Croyden.
&#8220;We supply the information, do all the work and
give up half the spoils&mdash;for what, pray?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For our silence, and an equal share in the
information. You have doubtless forgot that we
have the letter now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what if I refuse?&#8221; Croyden asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not likely to refuse!&#8221; the fellow
laughed, impudently. &#8220;Better half a big loaf than
no loaf at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But <i>if</i> I refuse?&#8221; Croyden repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see what&#8217;s in your mind, all right. But it
won&#8217;t work, and you know it. You can have us
arrested, yes&mdash;and lose your plunder. Parmenter&#8217;s
money belongs to the United States because it&#8217;s
buried in United States land. A word to the
Treasury Department, with the old pirate&#8217;s letter,
and the jig is up. We&#8217;ll risk your giving us to
the police, my friend!&#8221; with a sneering laugh. &#8220;If
you&#8217;re one to throw away good money, I miss my
guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden affected to consider.</p>
<p>&#8220;I forgot to say, that as you&#8217;re fixed so comfortable
here, me and Bill might as well stay with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
you&mdash;it will be more convenient, when you uncover
the chest, you know; in the excitement, you&#8217;re
liable to forget that we come in for a share.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything else you are moved to exact?&#8221; said
Croyden. His ears were primed, and they told him
that Macloud and Axtell were coming&mdash;&#8220;Let us
have them all, so I can decide&mdash;I want no afterthoughts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got them all&mdash;and very reasonable they
are!&#8221; laughed Hook-nose.</p>
<p>Just then, Macloud and Axtell stepped noiselessly
into the tent.</p>
<p>Something in Croyden&#8217;s face caused Hook-nose&#8217;s
laugh to end abruptly. He swung sharply around&mdash;and
faced Macloud&#8217;s leveled revolver&mdash;Axtell&#8217;s
covered his pal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hands up! Both of you!&#8221;&mdash;Croyden cried&mdash;&#8220;None
of that, Hook-nose!&mdash;make another motion
to draw a gun, and we&#8217;ll scatter your brains like
chickenfeed.&#8221; His own big revolver was sticking
out of Macloud&#8217;s pocket. He took it. &#8220;Now, I&#8217;ll
look after you, while my friends tie up your pal,
and the first one to open his head gets a bullet
down his throat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hands behind your back, Bald-head,&#8221; commanded
Axtell, briskly. &#8220;Be quick about it, Mr.
Macloud is wonderfully easy on the trigger. So,
that&#8217;s better! just hold them there a moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>He produced a pair of nippers, and snapped them
on.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now, lie down and put your feet together&mdash;closer!
closer!&#8221; Another pair were snapped on
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I&#8217;ll do for you,&#8221; Axtell remarked, turning
toward Hook-nose.</p>
<p>With Croyden&#8217;s and Macloud&#8217;s guns both covering
him, the fellow was quickly secured.</p>
<p>&#8220;With your permission, we will search you,&#8221; said
Croyden. &#8220;Macloud, if you will look to Mr.
Smith, I&#8217;ll attend to Hook-nose. We&#8217;ll give them a
taste of their own medicine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think you&#8217;re damn smart!&#8221; exclaimed
Hook-nose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up!&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care to
shoot a prisoner, but I&#8217;ll do it without hesitation.
It&#8217;s going to be either perfect quiet or permanent
sleep&mdash;and you may do the choosing.&#8221;</p>
<p>He slowly went through Hook-nose&#8217;s clothes&mdash;finding
a small pistol, several well-filled wallets,
and, in his inside waistcoat pocket, the Parmenter
letter. Macloud did the same for Bald-head.</p>
<p>&#8220;You stole one hundred and seventy-nine dollars
from Mr. Macloud and one hundred and eight
from me,&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;You may now have the
privilege of returning it, and the letter. If you
make no more trouble, lie quiet and take your
medicine, you&#8217;ll receive no further harm. If you&#8217;re
stubborn, we&#8217;ll either kill you and dump your bodies
in the Bay, or give you up to the police. The
latter would be less trouble, for, without the letter,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
you can tell your story to the Department, or
whomever else you please&mdash;it&#8217;s your word against
ours&mdash;and you are thieves!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long are you going to hold us prisoners?&#8221;
asked Bald-head&mdash;&#8220;till you find the treasure? Oh,
Lord!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As long as it suits our convenience.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And luck is with you,&#8221; Hook-nose sneered.</p>
<p>&#8220;At present, it <i>is</i> with us&mdash;very much with us,
my friend,&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;You will excuse
us, now, we have pressing business, elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they were out of hearing, Macloud said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t our recovery of Parmenter&#8217;s letter
change things very materially?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me it does,&#8221; Croyden answered.
&#8220;Indeed, I think we need fear the rogues no longer&mdash;we
can simply have them arrested for the theft
of our wallets, or even release them entirely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Arrest is preferable,&#8221; said Macloud. &#8220;It will
obviate all danger of our being shot at long range,
by the beggars. Let us put them where they&#8217;re
safe, for the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the arrest must not be made here!&#8221; interposed
Croyden. &#8220;We can&#8217;t send for the police:
if they find them here it would give color to their
story of a treasure on Greenberry Point.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Axtell and I will remain on guard, while
you go to town and arrange for their apprehension&mdash;say,
just as they come off the Severn bridge.
When you return, we can release them.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What if they don&#8217;t cross the Severn&mdash;what
if they scent our game, and keep straight on to
Baltimore? They can abandon their team, and
catch a Short Line train at a way station.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the Baltimore police can round them up.
I&#8217;m for chancing it. They&#8217;ve lost Parmenter&#8217;s
letter; haven&#8217;t anything to substantiate their
story. Furthermore, we have a permit for the
Chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee and
friends to camp here. I think that, now, we can
afford to ignore them&mdash;the recovery of the letter
was exceedingly lucky.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good!&#8221; said Macloud&mdash;&#8220;you&#8217;re the one
to be satisfied; it&#8217;s a whole heap easier than running
a private prison ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden looked the other&#8217;s horse over carefully,
so he could describe it accurately, then they hitched
up their own team and he drove off to Annapolis.</p>
<p>In due time, he returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right!&#8221; he said. &#8220;I told the Mayor
we had passed two men on the Severn bridge whom
we identified as those who picked our pockets,
Wednesday evening, in Carvel Hall&mdash;and gave him
the necessary descriptions. He recognized the
team as one of &#8216;Cheney&#8217;s Best,&#8217; and will have the
entire police force&mdash;which consists of four men&mdash;waiting
at the bridge on the Annapolis side.&#8221; He
looked at his watch. &#8220;They are there, now, so
we can turn the prisoners loose.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden and Macloud resumed their revolvers,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
and returned to the tent&mdash;to be greeted with a
volley of profanity which, for fluency and vocabulary,
was distinctly marvelous. Gradually, it died
away&mdash;for want of breath and words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Choice! Choice!&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;In the cuss
line, you two are the real thing. Why didn&#8217;t you
open up sooner?&mdash;you shouldn&#8217;t hide such proficiency
from an admiring world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whereat it flowed forth afresh from Hook-nose.
Bald-head, however, remained quiet, and there was a
faint twinkle in his eyes, as though he caught the
humor of the situation. They were severely
cramped, and in considerable pain, but their condition
was not likely to be benefited by swearing
at their captors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just listen to him!&#8221; said Croyden, as Hook-nose
took a fresh start. &#8220;Did you ever hear his
equal!... Now, if you&#8217;ll be quiet a moment, like
your pal, we will tell you something that possibly
you&#8217;ll not be averse to hear.... So, that&#8217;s better.
We&#8217;re about to release you&mdash;let you go free; it&#8217;s
too much bother to keep you prisoners. These
little toy guns of yours, however, we shall throw
into the Bay, in interest of the public peace. May
we trouble you, Mr. Axtell, to remove the bonds?...
Thank you! Now, you may arise and shake
yourselves&mdash;you&#8217;ll, likely, find the circulation a
trifle restricted, for a few minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hook-nose gave him a malevolent look, but made
no reply, Bald-head grinned broadly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now, if you have sufficiently recovered, we will
escort you to your carriage! Forward, march!&#8221;</p>
<p>And with the two thieves in front, and the three
revolvers bringing up the rear, they proceeded to
the buggy. The thieves climbed in.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wish you a very good day!&#8221; said Croyden.
&#8220;Drive on, please!&#8221;</p>

<h2>XI</h2>
<h3>ELAINE CAVENDISH</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;May we have seen the last of you!&#8221; said
Macloud, as the buggy disappeared among the
trees; &#8220;and may the police provide for you in
future.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And while you&#8217;re about it,&#8221; said Croyden,
&#8220;you might pray that we find the treasure&mdash;it
would be quite as effective.&#8221; He glanced at his
watch. &#8220;It&#8217;s four o&#8217;clock. Now, to resume where
those rogues interrupted us. We had the jewels
located, somewhere, within a radius of fifty feet.
They must be, according to our theory, either on
the bank or in the Bay. We can&#8217;t go at the
water without a boat. Shall we tackle the land at
once? or go to town and procure a boat, and be
ready for either in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have an idea,&#8221; said Macloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let it go to waste, old man, let&#8217;s have
it!&#8221; Croyden encouraged.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can give up hearing yourself talk,
for a moment, I&#8217;ll try!&#8221; laughed Macloud. &#8220;It
is conceded, I believe, that digging on the Point
by day may, probably will, provoke comment and
possibly investigation as well. My idea is this.
Do no work by day. Then as soon as dusky Night
has drawn her robes about her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Lord!&#8221; ejaculated Croyden, with upraised
hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, as soon as dusky Night has drawn her
robes about her,&#8221; Macloud repeated, imperturbably,
&#8220;we set to work, by the light of the silvery moon.
We arouse no comment&mdash;provoke no investigation.
When morning dawns, the sands are undisturbed,
and we are sleeping as peacefully as guinea pigs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if there isn&#8217;t a moon, we will set to work
by the light of the silvery lantern, I reckon!&#8221;
said Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;And, when we tackle the water, it will be in
a silver boat and with silver cuirasses and silver
helmets, à la Lohengrin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I suppose, our swan-song will be played
on silver flutes!&#8221; laughed Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;There won&#8217;t be a swan-song&mdash;we&#8217;re going to
find Parmenter&#8217;s treasure,&#8221; said Macloud.</p>
<p>Leaving Axtell in camp, they drove to town,
stopping at the North end of the Severn bridge
to hire a row-boat,&mdash;a number of which were drawn
up on the bank&mdash;and to arrange for it to be sent
around to the far end of the Point. At the hotel,
they found a telephone call from the Mayor&#8217;s
office awaiting them.</p>
<p>The thieves had been duly captured, the Mayor
said, and they had been sent to Baltimore. The
Chief of Detectives happened to be in the office,
when they were brought in, and had instantly
recognized them as well-known criminals, wanted in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
Philadelphia for a particularly atrocious hold-up.
He had, thereupon, thought it best to let the Chief
take them back with him, thus saving the County
the cost of a trial, and the penitentiary expense&mdash;as
well as sparing Mr. Croyden and his friend much
trouble and inconvenience in attending court. He
had had them searched, but found nothing which
could be identified. He hoped this was satisfactory.</p>
<p>Croyden assured him it was more than satisfactory.</p>
<p>That night they began the hunt. That night,
and every night for the next three weeks, they
kept at it.</p>
<p>They tested every conceivable hypothesis. They
dug up the entire zone of suspicion&mdash;it being loose
sand and easy to handle. On the plea that a
valuable ruby ring had been lost overboard while
fishing, they dragged and scraped the bottom of
the Bay for a hundred yards around. All without
avail. Nothing smiled on them but the weather&mdash;it
had remained uniformly good until the last two
days before. Then there had set in, from the North-east,
such a storm of rain as they had never
seen. The very Bay seemed to be gathered up
and dashed over the Point. They had sought
refuge in the hotel, when the first chilly blasts of
wind and water came up the Chesapeake. As it
grew fiercer,&mdash;and a negro sent out for information
returned with the news that their tents had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
been blown away, and all trace of the camp had
vanished&mdash;it was decided that the quest should be
abandoned.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a foolish hunt, anyway!&#8221; said Croyden.
&#8220;We knew from the first it couldn&#8217;t succeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we wanted to prove that it couldn&#8217;t succeed,&#8221;
Macloud observed. &#8220;If you hadn&#8217;t searched,
you always would have thought that, maybe, you
could have been successful. Now, you&#8217;ve had your
try&mdash;and you&#8217;ve failed. It will be easier to reconcile
yourself to failure, than not to have tried.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In other words, it&#8217;s better to have tried and
lost, than never to have tried at all,&#8221; Croyden
answered. &#8220;Well! it&#8217;s over and there&#8217;s no profit
in thinking more about it. We have had an enjoyable
camp, and the camp is ended. I&#8217;ll go
home and try to forget Parmenter, and the jewel
box he buried down on Greenberry Point.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll go with you,&#8221; said Macloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;To Hampton!&#8221; Croyden exclaimed, incredulously.</p>
<p>&#8220;To Hampton&mdash;if you can put up with me
a little longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>A knowing smile broke over Croyden&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Symphony in Blue?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe!&mdash;and maybe it is just you. At any
rate, I&#8217;ll come if I may.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Colin! You know you&#8217;re more than
welcome, always!&#8221;</p>
<p>Macloud bowed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go out to Northumberland
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
to-night, arrange a few matters which are
overdue, and come down to Hampton as soon as I
can get away.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The next afternoon, as Macloud was entering the
wide doorway of the Tuscarora Trust Company,
he met Elaine Cavendish coming out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stranger! where have you been these many
weeks?&#8221; she said, giving him her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of town,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Did you miss
me so much?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did! There isn&#8217;t a handy dinner man around,
with you and Geoffrey both away. Dine with us
this evening, will you?&mdash;it will be strictly <i>en
famille</i>, for I want to talk business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wants to talk business!&#8221; he thought, as,
having accepted, he went on to the coupon department.
&#8220;It has to do with that beggar
Croyden, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>And when, the dinner over, they were sitting
before the open grate fire, in the big living room,
she broached the subject without timidity, or false
pride.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are more familiar with Geoffrey Croyden&#8217;s
affairs than any one else, Colin,&#8221; she said, crossing
her knees, in the reckless fashion women have now-a-days,
and exposing a ravishing expanse of blue
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
silk stockings, with an unconscious consciousness
that was delightfully naive. &#8220;And I want to ask
you something&mdash;or rather, several things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Macloud blew a whiff of cigarette smoke into
the fire, and waited.</p>
<p>&#8220;I, naturally, don&#8217;t ask you to violate any confidence,&#8221;
she went on, &#8220;but I fancy you may tell me
this: was the particular business in which Geoffrey
was engaged, when I saw him in Annapolis, a success
or a failure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you ask!&#8221; Macloud said. &#8220;Did he
tell you anything concerning it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only that his return to Northumberland would
depend very much on the outcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But nothing as to its character?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it wasn&#8217;t a success; in fact, it was a
complete failure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And where is Geoffrey, now?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>She laughed lightly. &#8220;I do not mean, where
is he this minute, but where is he in general&mdash;where
would you address a wire, or a letter, and
know that it would be received?&#8221;</p>
<p>He threw his cigarette into the grate and lit
another.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not at liberty to tell,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, it is true&mdash;he is concealing himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly&mdash;he is not proclaiming himself&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not proclaiming himself or his whereabouts
to his Northumberland friends, you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Friends!&#8221; said Macloud. &#8220;Are there such
things as friends, when one has been unfortunate?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can answer only for myself,&#8221; she replied
earnestly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you, Elaine&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then tell me this&mdash;is he in this country or
abroad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In this country,&#8221; he said, after a pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he in want,&mdash;I mean, in want for the things
he has been used to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is not in want, I can assure you!&mdash;and
much that he was used to having, he has no use
for, now. Our wants are relative, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did he leave Northumberland so suddenly?&#8221;
she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;To reduce expenses. He was forced to give
up the old life, so he chose wisely, I think&mdash;to go
where his income was sufficient for his needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But <i>is</i> it sufficient?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;He says it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was silent for a while, staring into the
blaze. He did not interrupt&mdash;thinking it wise to
let her own thoughts shape the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will not tell me where he is?&#8221; she said
suddenly, bending her blue eyes hard upon his
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I may not, Elaine. I ought not to have
told you he was not abroad.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This business which you and he were on, in
Annapolis&mdash;it failed, you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;And is there no chance that it may succeed,
some time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has abandoned it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But may not conditions change&mdash;something
happen&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she began.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the sort that does not happen. In this
case, abandonment spells finis.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he know, when we were in Annapolis?&#8221;
she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary, he was very sanguine&mdash;it
looked most promising then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes went back to the flames. He blew
ring after ring of smoke, and waited, patiently.
He was the friend, he saw, now. He could never
hope to be more. Croyden was the lucky fellow&mdash;and
would not! Well, he had his warning and
it was in time. Since she was baring her soul to
him, as friend to friend, it was his duty to help
her to the utmost of his power.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she uncrossed her knees and sat up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have bought all the stock, and the remaining
bonds of the Virginia Development Company, from
the bank that held them as collateral for Royster
&amp; Axtell&#8217;s loan,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t be alarmed!
I didn&#8217;t appear in the matter&mdash;my broker bought
them in <i>your</i> name, and paid for them in actual
money.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am your friend&mdash;use me!&#8221; he said, simply.</p>
<p>She arose, and bending swiftly over, kissed him
on the cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, Elaine,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am, also, Geoffrey
Croyden&#8217;s friend, but there are temptations which
mortal man cannot resist.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think so?&#8221; she smiled, leaning over the
back of his chair, and putting her head perilously
close to his&mdash;&#8220;but I trust you&mdash;though I shan&#8217;t
kiss you again&mdash;at least, for the present. Now,
you have been so <i>very</i> good about the bonds, I
want you to be good some more. Will you, Colin?&#8221;</p>
<p>He held his hands before him, to put them out
of temptation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask me to crawl in the grate, and see how
quickly I do it!&#8221; he declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;It might prove my power, but I should lose
my friend,&#8221; she whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;And that would be inconvenient!&#8221; he laughed.
&#8220;Come, speak up! it&#8217;s already granted, that you
should know, Elaine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a very sweet boy,&#8221; she said, going
back to her seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which needs demonstration. But that you&#8217;re
a very sweet girl, needs no proof&mdash;unless&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
looking at her with a meaning smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would that be proof, think you?&#8221; with a
sidelong glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should accept it as such,&#8221; he averred&mdash;&#8220;whenever
you choose to confer it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Confer</i> smacks of reward for service done,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;Will it bide till then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if it may come sooner?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait&mdash;If you choose such pay, the&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I choose no pay,&#8221; he interrupted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, the reward will be in kind,&#8221; she answered
enigmatically. &#8220;I want you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She put one
slender foot on the fender, and gazed at it, meditatively,
while the firelight stole covert glances
at the silken ankles thus exposed. &#8220;I want you
to purchase for me, from Geoffrey Croyden, at
par, his Virginia Development Company bonds,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;You can do it through your broker.
I will give you a check, now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; he said; &#8220;wait until he sells&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think he won&#8217;t sell?&#8221; she inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he will have to be satisfied, first, as
to the purchaser&mdash;in plain words, that it isn&#8217;t
either you or I. We can&#8217;t give Geoffrey money!
The bonds are practically worthless, as he knows
only too well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had thought of that,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but, isn&#8217;t
it met by this very plan? Your broker purchases
the bonds for your account, but he, naturally,
declines to reveal the identity of his customer. You
can, truthfully, tell Geoffrey that <i>you</i> are not buying
them&mdash;for you&#8217;re not. And <i>I</i>&mdash;if he will only
give me the chance&mdash;will assure him that I am <i>not</i>
buying them from him&mdash;and you might confirm it,
if he asked.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hum! It&#8217;s juggling with the facts&mdash;though
true on the face,&#8221; said Macloud, &#8220;but it&#8217;s pretty
thin ice we&#8217;re skating on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are assuming he suspects or questions.
He may take the two hundred thousand and ask
no question.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t for a moment believe that!&#8221; he
laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i> doubtful,&#8221; she admitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you wouldn&#8217;t think the same of him, if he
did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I admit it!&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, we are back to the thin ice. I&#8217;ll do what
I can; but, you forgot, I am not at liberty to
give his address to my brokers. I shall have to
take their written offer to buy, and forward it to
him, which, in itself will oblige me, at the same
time, to tell him that <i>I</i> am not the purchaser.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I leave it entirely to you&mdash;manage it any way
you see fit. All I ask, is that you get him to sell.
It&#8217;s horrible to think of Geoffrey being reduced to
the bare necessities of life&mdash;for that&#8217;s what it
means, when he goes &#8216;where his income is sufficient
for his needs.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s unfortunate, certainly: it would be vastly
worse for a woman&mdash;to go from luxury to frugality,
from everything to relatively nothing is
positively pathetic. However, Croyden is not suffering&mdash;he
has an attractive house filled with old
things, good victuals, a more than competent cook,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
and plenty of society. He has cut out all the
non-essentials, and does the essentials economically.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have been there?&#8221; she demanded. &#8220;You
speak of your own knowledge, not from his inferences?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been there!&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the society&mdash;what of it?&#8221; she asked
quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better than our own!&#8221; he said, instantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; she replied with lifted eye-brows.
&#8220;Our own in the aggregate or differentiated?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the aggregate!&#8221; he laughed; &#8220;but quite
the equal of our own differentiated. If Croyden
were a marrying man&mdash;with sufficient income for
two&mdash;I should give him about six months, at the
outside.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And how much would you give one with sufficient
for two&mdash;<i>yourself</i>, for instance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just long enough to choose the girl&mdash;and convince
her of the propriety of the choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And do you expect to join Geoffrey, soon?&#8221;
meaningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as I can get through here,&mdash;probably
in a day or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, we may look for the new Mrs. Macloud
in time for the holidays, I presume.&mdash;Sort of a
Christmas gift?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About then&mdash;if I can pick among so many,
and she ratifies the pick.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t, yet, chosen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&mdash;there are so many I didn&#8217;t have time to
more than look them over. When I go back, I&#8217;ll
round them up, cut out the most likely, and try
to tie and brand her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Colin!&#8221; cried Miss Cavendish. &#8220;One would
think, from your talk, that Geoffrey was in a
cowboy camp, with waitresses for society.&#8221;</p>
<p>He grinned, and lighted a fresh cigarette.</p>
<p>She tossed him an alluring look.</p>
<p>&#8220;And nothing can induce you to tell me the
location of the camp?&#8221; she implored.</p>
<p>He smoked, a bit, in silence. Should he or should
he not?...</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&mdash;not now!&#8221; he said, slowly. &#8220;Let us
try the bond matter, first. If he sells, I think he
will return; if not, I&#8217;ll then consider telling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a good fellow, Colin, dear!&#8221; she whispered,
leaning over and giving his hand an affectionate
little pat. &#8220;You&#8217;re so nice and comfortable
to have around&mdash;you never misunderstand,
nor draw inferences that you shouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which means, I&#8217;m not to draw inferences
now?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor at any other time,&#8221; she remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the reward?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will be forthcoming,&#8221; with an alluring smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a mind to take part payment now,&#8221; said
he, intercepting the hand before she could withdraw
it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If you can, sir!&#8221; whisking it loose, and darting
around a table.</p>
<p>&#8220;A challenge, is it? Oh, very well!&#8221; and he
sprang after.</p>
<p>With a swift movement, she swept up her skirts
and fled&mdash;around chairs, and tables, across rugs,
over sofas and couches&mdash;always man&oelig;uvring to
gain the doorway, yet always finding him barring
the way;&mdash;until, at last, she was forced to refuge
behind a huge davenport, standing with one end
against the wall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, will you surrender?&#8221; he demanded, coming
slowly toward her in the cul de sac.</p>
<p>She shook her head, smiling the while.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be merciful,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is five steps,
until I reach you&mdash;One!&mdash;Will you yield?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two!&mdash;will you yield?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Three!&mdash;will you yield?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Four&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Quick as thought, she dropped one hand on the
back of the davenport; there was a flash of slippers,
lingerie and silk, and she was across and
racing for the door, now fair before her, leaving
him only the echo of a mocking laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Five!&#8221; she counted, tauntingly, from the hall.
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you continue, sir?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I stop with four,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be good for
to-night, Elaine&mdash;you need have no further fear.&#8221;</p>
<p>She tossed her head ever so slightly, while a
bantering look came into her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not much afraid of you, now&mdash;nor any
time,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;But you have more courage
than I would have thought, Colin&mdash;decidedly
more!&#8221;</p>

<h2>XII</h2>
<h3>ONE LEARNED IN THE LAW</h3>
</div>

<p>It was evening, when Croyden returned to
Hampton&mdash;an evening which contained no suggestion
of the Autumn he had left behind him on the
Eastern Shore. It was raw, and damp, and chill,
with the presage of winter in its cold; the leaves
were almost gone from the trees, the blackening
hand of frost was on flower and shrubbery. As
he passed up the dreary, deserted street, the wind
was whistling through the branches over head, and
moaning around the houses like spirits of the
damned.</p>
<p>He turned in at Clarendon&mdash;shivering a little
at the prospect. He was beginning to appreciate
what a winter spent under such conditions meant,
where one&#8217;s enjoyments and recreations are circumscribed
by the bounds of comparatively few
houses and few people&mdash;people, he suspected, who
could not understand what he missed, of the hurly-burly
of life and amusement, even if they tried.
Their ways were sufficient for them; they were
eminently satisfied with what they had; they could
not comprehend dissatisfaction in another, and
would have no patience with it.</p>
<p>He could imagine the dismalness of Hampton,
when contrasted with the brightness of Northumberland.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
The theatres, the clubs, the constant
dinners, the evening affairs, the social whirl with
all that it comprehended, compared with an occasional
dinner, a rare party, interminable evenings
spent, by his own fireside, alone! Alone! Alone!</p>
<p>To be sure, Miss Carrington, and Miss Borden,
and Miss Lashiel, and Miss Tilghman, would be
available, when they were home. But the winter
was when they went visiting, he remembered, from
late November until early April, and, at that
period, the town saw them but little. There was
the Hampton Club, of course, but it was worse
than nothing&mdash;an opportunity to get mellow and
to gamble, innocent enough to those who were
habituated to it, but dangerous to one who had
fallen, by adversity, from better things....</p>
<p>However, Macloud would be there, shortly, thank
God! And the dear girls were not going for a
week or so, he hoped. And, when the worst came,
he could retire to the peacefulness of his library
and try to eke out a four months&#8217; existence, with
the books, and magazines and papers.</p>
<p>Moses held open the door, with a bow and a
flourish, and the lights leaped out to meet him.
It was some cheer, at least, to come home to a
bright house, a full larder, faithful servants&mdash;and
supper ready on the table, and tuned to even
a Clubman&#8217;s taste.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moses, do you know if Miss Carrington&#8217;s at
home?&#8221; he asked, the coffee on and his cigar lit.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yass, seh! her am home, seh, I seed she herse&#8217;f
dis mornin&#8217; cum down de parf from de front
poach wid de dawg, seh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden nodded and went across the hall to
the telephone.</p>
<p>Miss Carrington, herself, answered his call.&mdash;Yes,
she intended to be home all evening. She
would be delighted to see him and to hear a full
account of himself.</p>
<p>He was rather surprised at his own alacrity, in
finishing his cigar and changing his clothes&mdash;and
he wondered whether it was the girl, or the companionship,
or the opportunity to be free of himself?
A little of all three, he concluded.... But,
especially, the <i>girl</i>, as she came from the drawing-room
to meet him.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you have really returned,&#8221; she said, as he
bowed over her slender fingers. &#8220;We were beginning
to fear you had deserted us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are quite too modest,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t appreciate your own attractions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;you&#8221; was plainly singular, but she refused
to see it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our own attractions require us to be modest,&#8221;
she returned; &#8220;with a&mdash;man of the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;Whatever I may have
been, I am, now, a man of Hampton.&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head. &#8220;You can never be a man
of Hampton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not, if I live among you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If you live here&mdash;take on our ways, our beliefs,
our mode of thinking, you may, in a score
of years, grow like us, outwardly; but, inwardly,
where the true like must start, <i>never</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do we differ?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask me something easier! You&#8217;ve been bred
differently, used to different things, to doing them
in a different way. We do things slowly, leisurely,
with a fine disregard of time, you, with the modern
rush, and bustle, and hurry. You are a man of
the world&mdash;I repeat it&mdash;up to the minute in everything&mdash;never
lagging behind, unless you wish.
You never put off till to-morrow what you can
do to-day. We never do anything to-day that
can be put off till to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And which do you prefer, the to-day or the
to-morrow?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It depends on my humor, and my location,
at the time&mdash;though, I must admit, the to-day
makes for thrift, and business, and success in
acquiring wealth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And success also in getting rid of it. It is
a return toward the primitive condition&mdash;the survival
of the fittest. There must be losers as well
as acquirers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the pity of it!&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;that
one must lose in order that another may gain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But as we are not in Utopia or Altruria,&#8221; he
smiled, &#8220;it will continue so to be. Why, even in
Baltimore, they&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Baltimore is only an overgrown country
town!&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Granted!&#8221; he replied. &#8220;With half a million
population, it is as provincial as Hampton, and
thanks God for it&mdash;the most smug, self-satisfied,
self-sufficient municipality in the land, with its
cobblestones, its drains-in-the-gutters, its how much-holier-than-thou
air about everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it has excellent railway facilities!&#8221; she
laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it happens to be on the main line
between Washington and the North.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At least, the people are nice, barring a few
mushrooms who are making a great to-do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the people <i>are</i> delightful!&mdash;And, when
it comes to mushrooms, Northumberland has
Baltimore beaten to a frazzle. We raise a fresh
crop every night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Northumberland society must be exceedingly
large!&#8221; she laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is&mdash;but it&#8217;s not overcrowded. About as
many die every day, as are born every night;
and, at any rate, they don&#8217;t interfere with those
who really belong&mdash;except to increase prices, and
the cost of living, and clog the avenue with automobiles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is progress!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s progress! but whither it leads no
one knows&mdash;to the devil, likely&mdash;or a lemon
garden.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Blessed are the lemons on earth, for they
shall be peaches in Heaven!&#8217;&#8221; she quoted.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a glorious peach your Miss Erskine will
be,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you don&#8217;t appreciate the great
honor the lady did you, in condescending to view
the <i>treasures</i> of Clarendon, and to talk about
them afterward. To hear her, she is the most
intimate friend you have in Hampton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad you told me. Somehow,
I&#8217;m always drawing lemons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I a lemon?&#8221; she asked, abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You! do you think you are?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One can never know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have I drawn <i>you</i>?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite immaterial to the question, which is: A
lemon or not a lemon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you could but see yourself at this moment,
you would not ask,&#8221; he said, looking at her with
amused scrutiny.</p>
<p>The lovely face, the blue black hair, the fine
figure in the simple pink organdie, the slender
ankles, the well-shod feet&mdash;a lemon!</p>
<p>&#8220;But as I can&#8217;t see myself, and have no mirror
handy, your testimony is desired,&#8221; she insisted. &#8220;A
lemon or not a lemon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A lemon!&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you can&#8217;t have any objection&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you bring Miss Erskine in?&#8221; he interrupted.
&#8220;Nay! Nay! <i>Nay!</i> <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Nay!</span>&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;&mdash;if I take you there for a game of Bridge&mdash;shall
we go this very evening?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you wish,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>She laughed. &#8220;I don&#8217;t wish&mdash;and we are growing
very silly. Come, tell about your Annapolis
trip. You stayed a great while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Something more than three weeks!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a queer old town, Annapolis&mdash;they call it
the &#8216;Finished City!&#8217; It&#8217;s got plenty of landmarks,
and relics, but nothing more. If it were not for
the State Capitol and Naval Academy, it would
be only a lot of ruins, lost in the sand. In midsummer,
it&#8217;s absolutely dead. No one on the streets,
no one in the shops, no one any place.&mdash;Deserted&mdash;until
there&#8217;s a fire. Then you should see them
come out!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is sufficiently expressed!&#8221; laughed
Croyden. &#8220;But, with the autumn and the
Academy in session, the town seemed very much
alive. We sampled &#8216;Cheney&#8217;s Best,&#8217; Wegard&#8217;s
Cakes, and saw the Custard-and-Cream Chapel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been to Annapolis, sure!&#8221; she replied.
&#8220;There&#8217;s only one thing more&mdash;did you
see Paul Jones?&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head. &#8220;We missed him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which isn&#8217;t surprising. You can&#8217;t find him
without the aid of a detective or a guide.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, who ever finds him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No one!&mdash;and there is the shame. We accepted
the vast labors and the money of our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
Ambassador to France in locating the remains of
America&#8217;s first Naval Hero; we sent an Embassy
and a warship to bring them back; we received
them with honor, orated over them, fired guns over
them. And then, when the spectators had departed&mdash;assuming
they were to be deposited in the
crypt of the Chapel&mdash;we calmly chucked them away
on a couple of trestles, under a stairway in Bancroft
Hall, as we would an old broom or a tin
can. That&#8217;s <i>our</i> way of honoring the only Naval
Commander we had in the Revolution. It would
have been better, much better, had we left him to
rest in the quiet seclusion of his grave in France&mdash;lost,
save in memory, with the halo of the past
and privacy of death around him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And why didn&#8217;t we finish the work?&#8221; said
Croyden. &#8220;Why bring him here, with the attendant
expense, and then stop, just short of completion?
Why didn&#8217;t we inter him in the Chapel
(though, God save me from burial there), or any
place, rather than on trestles under a stairway
in a midshipmen&#8217;s dormitory?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because the appropriation was exhausted, or
because the Act wasn&#8217;t worded to include burial,
or because the Superintendent didn&#8217;t want the
bother, or because it was a nuisance to have the
remains around&mdash;or some other absurd reason. At
all events, he is there in the cellar, and he is likely
to stay there, till Bancroft Hall is swallowed up
by the Bay. The junket to France, the parade,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
the speeches, the spectacular part are over, so, who
cares for the entombment, and the respect due the
distinguished dead?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean to be disrespectful,&#8221; he observed,
&#8220;but it&#8217;s hard luck to have one&#8217;s bones disturbed,
after more than a hundred years of tranquillity,
to be conveyed clear across the Atlantic, to be
orated over, and sermonized over, and, then, to be
flung aside like old junk and forgot. However,
we have troubles of our own&mdash;I know I have&mdash;more
real than Paul Jones! He may be glad he&#8217;s
dead, so he won&#8217;t have any to worry over. In
fact, it&#8217;s a good thing to be dead&mdash;one is saved
from a heap of worry.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him, without replying.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use?&#8221; he said. &#8220;A daily struggle
to procure fuel sufficient to keep up the fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use of anything! Why not make
an end of life, at once?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes, I&#8217;m tempted,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;It&#8217;s
the leap in the dark, and no returning, that restrains,
I reckon&mdash;and the fact that we must face
it alone. Otherwise&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed softly. &#8220;Otherwise death would
have no terrors! You have begged the question,
or what amounts to it. But, to return to
Annapolis; what else did you see?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have been there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Many times.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you know what I saw,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
had no wonderful adventures. This isn&#8217;t the day
of the rapier and the mask.&#8221;</p>
<p>She half closed her eyes and looked at him
through the long lashes.</p>
<p>&#8220;What were you doing down on Greenberry
Point?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you know?&#8221; he asked, surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! very naturally. I was in Annapolis&mdash;I
saw your name on the register&mdash;I inquired&mdash;and
I had the tale of the camp. No one, however,
seemed to think it queer!&#8221; laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should they? Camping out is entirely
natural,&#8221; Croyden answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the Chairman of the Senate Committee
on Naval Affairs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We were in his party!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A party which until five days ago he had
not joined&mdash;at least, so the Superintendent told
me, when I dined at his house. He happened to
mention your name, found I knew you&mdash;and we
gossiped. Perhaps we shouldn&#8217;t, but we did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What else did he tell you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing! he didn&#8217;t seem even to wonder at
your being there&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But <i>you</i> did?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the small town in me, I suppose&mdash;to be
curious about other people and their business; and
it was most suspicious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was most suspicious?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your actions. First, you hire a boat and cross
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
the Bay direct from Hampton to Annapolis.
Second, you procure, through Senator Rickrose,
a permit from the Secretary of the Navy to camp
on Greenberry Point. Third, you actually do camp,
there, for nearly, or quite three weeks. Query:&mdash;Why?
Why go clear to the Western Shore, and
choose a comparatively inaccessible and exposed
location on United States property, if the idea
were only a camp? Why not camp over on Kent
Island, or on this coast? Anywhere, within a
few miles of Hampton, there are scores of places
better adapted than Greenberry Point.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You should be a story teller!&#8221; he laughed.
&#8220;Your imagination is marvelous. With a series
of premises, you can reach whatever conclusion you
wish&mdash;you&#8217;re not bound by the probabilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re simply obscuring the point,&#8221; she insisted.
&#8220;In this instance, my premises are facts
which are not controverted. You admit them to
be correct. So, why? Why?&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She held up
her hand. &#8220;Don&#8217;t answer! I&#8217;m not asking for
information. I don&#8217;t want to be told. I&#8217;m simply
&#8216;chaffing of you,&#8217; don&#8217;t you know!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With just a lingering curiosity, however,&#8221; he
added.</p>
<p>&#8220;A casual curiosity, rather,&#8221; she amended.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which, some time, I shall gratify. You&#8217;ve
trailed me down&mdash;we <i>were</i> on Greenberry Point for
a purpose, but nothing has come of it, yet&mdash;and
it&#8217;s likely a failure.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Mr. Croyden, I don&#8217;t wish to know.
It was a mistake to refer to it. I should simply
have forgot what I heard in Annapolis&mdash;I&#8217;ll forget
now, if you will permit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By no means, Miss Carrington. You can&#8217;t
forget, if you would&mdash;and I would not have you,
if you could. Moreover, I inherited it along with
Clarendon, and, as you were my guide to the
place, it&#8217;s no more than right that you should
know. I think I shall confide in you&mdash;no use to
protest, it&#8217;s got to come!&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are determined?&mdash;Very well, then, come
over to the couch in the corner, where we can
sit close and you can whisper.&#8221;</p>
<p>He arose, with alacrity. She put out her hand
and led him&mdash;and he suffered himself to be led.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now!&#8221; when they were seated, &#8220;you may begin.
Once upon a time&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and laughed, softly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll take this, if you&#8217;ve no immediate use for
it,&#8221; she said, and released her hand from his.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the moment,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I shall want it
back, presently, however.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you, by any chance, get all you want?&#8221;
she inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alas! no! Else I would have kept what I
already had.&#8221;</p>
<p>She put her hands behind her, and faced around.</p>
<p>&#8220;Begin, sir!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Begin! and try to
be serious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&mdash;once upon a time&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Then he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
stopped. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go over to the house and get the
letter&mdash;it will tell you much better than I can.
You will wait here, <i>right here</i>, until I return?&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him, with a tantalizing smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t it be enough, if I am here <i>when</i> you
return?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>When he came out on the piazza the rain had
ceased, the clouds were gone, the temperature had
fallen, and the stars were shining brightly in a
winter sky.</p>
<p>He strode quickly down the walk to the street
and crossed it diagonally to his own gates. As
he passed under the light, which hung near the
entrance, a man walked from the shadow of the
Clarendon grounds and accosted him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Croyden, I believe?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Croyden halted, abruptly, just out of distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Croyden is my name?&#8221; he replied, interrogatingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;With your permission, I will accompany you
to your house&mdash;to which I assume you are bound&mdash;for
a few moments&#8217; private conversation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Concerning what?&#8221; Croyden demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Concerning a matter of business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My business or yours?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Both!&#8221; said the man, with a smile.</p>
<p>Croyden eyed him suspiciously. He was about
thirty years of age, tall and slender, was well
dressed, in dark clothes, a light weight top-coat,
and a derby hat. His face was ordinary, however,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
and Croyden had no recollection of ever having
seen it&mdash;certainly not in Hampton.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not in the habit of discussing business
with strangers, at night, nor of taking them to
my house,&#8221; he answered, brusquely. &#8220;If you have
anything to say to me, say it now, and be brief.
I&#8217;ve no time to waste.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some one may hear us,&#8221; the man objected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let them&mdash;I&#8217;ve no objection.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me, but I think, in this matter, you
would have objection.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll say it quickly, and here, or not at all,&#8221;
snapped Croyden.</p>
<p>The man shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s scarcely a subject to be discussed on the
street,&#8221; he observed, &#8220;but, if I must, I must.
Did you ever hear of Robert Parmenter? Oh! I
see that you have! Well, the business concerns
a certain letter&mdash;need I be more explicit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you wish to make your business intelligible.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fellow shrugged his shoulders again.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you wish,&#8221; he said, &#8220;though it only consumes
time, and I was under the impression that
you were in a hurry. However: To repeat&mdash;the
business concerns a letter, which has to do with a
certain treasure buried long ago, on Greenberry
Point, by the said Robert Parmenter. Do I make
myself plain, now, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your language is entirely intelligible&mdash;though
I cannot answer for the facts recited.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></p>
<p>The man smiled imperturbably, and went on:</p>
<p>&#8220;The letter in question having come into your
possession recently, you, with two companions,
spent three weeks encamped on Greenberry Point,
ostensibly for your health, or the night air, or
anything else that would deceive the Naval
authorities. During which time, you dug up the
entire Point, dragged the waters immediately adjoining&mdash;and
then departed, very strangely choosing
for it a time of storm and change of weather.
My language is intelligible, thus far?&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden nodded&mdash;rather amused. Evidently,
the thieves had managed to communicate with a
confederate, and this was a hold-up. They assumed
he had been successful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Therefore, it is entirely reasonable to suppose
that your search was not ineffectual. In plain
words, you have recovered the treasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man paused, waiting for an answer.</p>
<p>Croyden only smiled, and waited, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good!&mdash;we will proceed,&#8221; said the
stranger. &#8220;The jewels were found on Government
land. It makes no difference whether recovered
on the Point or on the Bay&mdash;the law covering
treasure trove, I am informed, doesn&#8217;t apply.
The Government is entitled to the entire
find, it being the owner in fee of the land.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You talk like a lawyer!&#8221; said Croyden.</p>
<p>The stranger bowed. &#8220;I have devoted my
spare moments to the study of the law&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And how to avoid it,&#8221; Croyden interjected.</p>
<p>The other bowed again.</p>
<p>&#8220;And also how to prevent <i>others</i> from avoiding
it,&#8221; he replied, suggestively. &#8220;Let us take
up that phase, if it please you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if it doesn&#8217;t please?&#8221; asked Croyden,
suppressing an inclination to laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let us take it up, any way&mdash;unless you
wish to forfeit your find to the Government.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Proceed!&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;We are arriving,
now, at the pith of the matter. What do you
offer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We want an equal divide. We will take Parmenter&#8217;s
estimate and multiply it by two, though
jewels have appreciated more than that in valuation.
Fifty thousand pounds is two hundred and
fifty thousand dollars, which will total, according
to the calculation, half a million dollars,&mdash;one
half of which amount you pay us as our share.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your share! Why don&#8217;t you call it properly&mdash;blackmail?&#8221;
Croyden demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you wish!&#8221; the other replied, airily. &#8220;If
you prefer blackmail to share, it will not hinder
the contract&mdash;seeing that it is quite as illegal on
your part as on ours. Share merely sounds a little
better but either obtains the same end. So, suit
yourself. Call it what you will&mdash;but <i>pay</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pay&mdash;or what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pay&mdash;or lose everything!&#8221; was the answer.
&#8220;If you are not familiar with the law covering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
the subject under discussion, let me enlighten you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thunder! how you do roll it out!&#8221; laughed
Croyden. &#8220;Get on! man, get on!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was endeavoring to state the matter succinctly,&#8221;
the stranger replied, refusing to be hurried
or flustered. &#8220;The Common Law and the
practice of the Treasury Department provide, that
all treasure found on Government land or within
navigable waters, is Government property. If declared
by the finder, immediately, he shall be paid
such reward as the Secretary may determine. If
he does not declare, and is informed on, the informer
gets the reward. You will observe that,
under the law, you have forfeited the jewels&mdash;I
fancy I do not need to draw further deductions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&mdash;it&#8217;s quite unnecessary,&#8221; Croyden remarked.
&#8220;Your fellow thieves went into that phase
(good word, I like it!) rather fully, down on
Greenberry Point. Unluckily, they fell into the
hands of the police, almost immediately, and we
have not been able to continue the conversation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have the honor to continue the conversation&mdash;and,
in the interim, you have found the treasure.
So, Parmenter&#8217;s letter won&#8217;t be essential&mdash;the facts,
circumstances, your own and Mr. Macloud&#8217;s testimony,
will be sufficient to prove the Government&#8217;s
case. Then, as you are aware, it&#8217;s pay or go to
prison for larceny.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is one very material hypothesis, which
you assume as a fact, but which is, unfortunately,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
not a fact,&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;We did not find
the treasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man laughed, good-humoredly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Naturally!&#8221; he replied. &#8220;We don&#8217;t ask you
to acknowledge the finding&mdash;just pay over the
quarter of a million and we will forget everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My good man, I&#8217;m speaking the truth!&#8221;
Croyden answered. &#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s difficult for you
to recognize, but it&#8217;s the truth, none the less. I
only wish I <i>had</i> the treasure&mdash;I think I&#8217;d be quite
willing to share it, even with a blackmailer!&#8221;</p>
<p>The man laughed, again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I trust it will give no offence if I say I don&#8217;t
believe you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can believe what you damn please!&#8221;
Croyden retorted.</p>
<p>And, without more ado, he turned his back and
went up the path to Clarendon.</p>

<h3>I COULD TELL SOME THINGS</h3>
</div>

<p>When Croyden had got Parmenter&#8217;s letter from
the secret drawer in the escritoire, he rang the old-fashioned
pull-bell for Moses. It was only a little
after nine, and, though he did not require the
negro to remain in attendance until he retired, he
fancied the kitchen fire still held him.</p>
<p>And he was not mistaken. In a moment Moses
appeared&mdash;his eyes heavy with the sleep from which
he had been aroused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Survent, marster!&#8221; he said, bowing from the
doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moses, did you ever shoot a pistol?&#8221; Croyden
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fur de Lawd, seh! Hit&#8217;s bin so long sence
I dun hit, I t&#8217;ink I&#8217;se gun-shy, seh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have done it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yass, seh, I has don hit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you could do it again, if necessary?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I speck so, seh&mdash;leas&#8217;wise, I kin try&mdash;dough
I&#8217;se mons&#8217;us unsuttin, seh, mons&#8217;us unsuttin!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncertain of what&mdash;your shooting or your
hitting?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My hittin&#8217;, seh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;re all of us somewhat uncertain in
that line. At least you know enough not to point
the revolver toward yourself.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hi!&mdash;I sut&#8217;n&#8217;y does! seh, I sut&#8217;n&#8217;y does!&#8221; said
the negro, with a broad grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a revolver, yonder, on the table,&#8221;
said Croyden, indicating one of those they used on
Greenberry Point. &#8220;It&#8217;s a self-cocker&mdash;you simply
pull the trigger and the action does the rest. You
understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yass, seh, I onderstands,&#8221; said Moses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring it here,&#8221; Croyden ordered.</p>
<p>Moses&#8217; fingers closed around the butt, a bit
timorously, and he carried it to his master.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you the action,&#8221; said Croyden.
&#8220;Here, is the ejector,&#8221; throwing the chamber out,
&#8220;it holds six shots, you see: but you never put a
cartridge under the firing-pin, because, if anything
strikes the trigger, it&#8217;s likely to be discharged.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yass, seh!&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden loaded it, closed the cylinder, and
passed it over to Moses, who took it with a little
more assurance. He was harkening back thirty
years, and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do yo warn me to do, seh?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to sit down, here, while I&#8217;m away,
and if any one tries to get in this house, to-night,
you&#8217;re to shoot him. I&#8217;m going over to Captain
Carrington&#8217;s&mdash;I&#8217;ll be back by eleven o&#8217;clock. It
isn&#8217;t likely you will be disturbed; if you are, one
shot will frighten him off, even if you don&#8217;t hit
him, and I&#8217;ll hear the shot, and come back at once.
You understand?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yass, seh!&mdash;I&#8217;m to shoot anyone what tries to
get in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly!&#8221; laughed Croyden. &#8220;You&#8217;re to
shoot anyone who tries to <i>break</i> in. For Heaven&#8217;s
sake! don&#8217;t shoot me, when I return, or any one
else who comes legitimately. Be sure he is an intruder,
then bang away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sut&#8217;n&#8217;y, seh! I onderstands. I&#8217;se dub&#8217;us bout
hittin&#8217;, but I kin bang away right nuf. Does yo&#8217;
spose any one will try to git in, seh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t!&#8221; Croyden smiled&mdash;&#8220;but you be
ready for them, Moses, be ready for them. It&#8217;s
just as well to provide against contingencies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yass, seh!&#8221; as Croyden went out and the front
door closed behind him, &#8220;but dem &#8217;tingencies is
monty dang&#8217;ous t&#8217;ings to fools wid. I don&#8217; likes
hit, dat&#8217;s whar I don&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden found Miss Carrington just where he
had left her&mdash;a quick return to the sofa having
been synchronous with his appearance in the hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a mind not to wait here,&#8221; she said; &#8220;you
were an inordinately long time, Mr. Croyden.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was!&#8221; he replied, sitting down beside her.
&#8220;I was, and I admit it&mdash;but it can be explained.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m listening!&#8221; she smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before you listen to me, listen to Robert Parmenter,
deceased!&#8221; said he, and gave her the letter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, this is the letter&mdash;do you mean that I am
to read it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If you please!&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>She read it through without a single word of
comment&mdash;an amazing thing in a woman, who,
when her curiosity is aroused, can ask more questions
to the minute than can be answered in a
month. When she had finished, she turned back
and read portions of it again, especially the direction
as to finding the treasure, and the postscript
bequests by the Duvals.</p>
<p>At last, she dropped the letter in her lap and
looked up at Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;A most remarkable document!&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Most extraordinary in its ordinariness, and most
ordinary in its extraordinariness. And you
searched, carefully, for three weeks and found&mdash;nothing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We did,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Now, I&#8217;ll tell you about
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;First, tell me where you obtained this letter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I found it by accident&mdash;in a secret compartment
of an escritoire at Clarendon,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you may tell me about it?&#8221; she said, and
settled back to listen.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the tale of Parmenter&#8217;s treasure&mdash;and
how we did <i>not</i> find it!&#8221; he laughed.</p>
<p>Then he proceeded to narrate, briefly, the details&mdash;from
the finding of the letter to the present
moment, dwelling particularly on the episode of
the theft of their wallets, the first and second coming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
of the thieves to the Point, their capture and
subsequent release, together with the occurrence of
this evening, when he was approached, by the well-dressed
stranger, at Clarendon&#8217;s gates.</p>
<p>And, once again, marvelous to relate, Miss Carrington
did not interrupt, through the entire course
of the narrative. Nor did she break the silence
for a time after he had concluded, staring thoughtfully,
the while, down into the grate, where a
smouldering back log glowed fitfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you intend to do, as to the treasure?&#8221;
she asked, slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give it up!&#8221; he replied. &#8220;What else is there
to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what about this stranger?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He <i>must</i> give it up!&#8221; laughed Croyden. &#8220;He
has no recourse. In the words of the game, popular
hereabout, he is playing a bobtail!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he doesn&#8217;t know it&#8217;s a bobtail. He is
convinced you found the treasure,&#8221; she objected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him make whatever trouble he can, it won&#8217;t
bother me, in the least.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is not acting alone,&#8221; she persisted. &#8220;He
has confederates&mdash;they may attack Clarendon, in
an effort to capture the treasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear child! this is the twentieth century,
not the seventeenth!&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;We don&#8217;t
&#8216;stand-by to repel boarders,&#8217; these days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pirate&#8217;s gold breeds pirate&#8217;s ways!&#8221; she
answered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>He stared at her, in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather queer!&mdash;I&#8217;ve heard those same words
before, in this connection.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Community of minds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it a quotation?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly&mdash;though I don&#8217;t recall it. Suppose
you are attacked and tortured till you reveal where
you&#8217;ve hidden the jewels?&#8221; she insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot suppose them so unreasonable!&#8221; he
laughed, again. &#8220;However, I put Moses on guard&mdash;with
a big revolver and orders to fire at anyone
molesting the house. If we hear a fusillade we&#8217;ll
know it&#8217;s he shooting up the neighborhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the same idea <i>did</i> suggest itself to you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only to the extent of searching for the jewels&mdash;I
regarded that as vaguely possible, but there
isn&#8217;t the slightest danger of any one being tortured.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know best, I suppose,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;but
you&#8217;ve had your warning&mdash;and pirate&#8217;s gold breeds
pirate&#8217;s ways. You&#8217;ve given up all hope of finding
the treasure&mdash;abandoned jewels worth&mdash;how many
dollars?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly half a million,&#8221; he filled in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without a further search? Oh! Mr. Croyden!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can suggest what to do&mdash;anything
which hasn&#8217;t been done, I shall be only too glad
to consider it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You say you dug up the entire Point for a
hundred yards inland?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And dredged the Bay for a hundred yards?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>She puckered her brows in thought. He regarded
her with an amused smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what you&#8217;re to do, except to do it
all over again,&#8221; she announced&mdash;&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t
laugh! It may sound foolish, but many a thing
has been found on a second seeking&mdash;and this,
surely, is worth a second, or a third, or even many
seekings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If there were any assurance of ultimate success,
it would pay to spend a lifetime hunting.
The two essentials, however, are wanting: the extreme
tip of Greenberry Point in 1720, and the
beech-trees. We made the best guess at their location.
More than that, the zone of exploration embraced
every possible extreme of territory&mdash;yet, we
failed. It will make nothing for success to try
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is somewhere!&#8221; she reflected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somewhere, in the Bay!&mdash;It&#8217;s shoal water, for
three or four hundred feet around the Point, with
a rock bottom. The Point itself has been eaten
into by the Bay, down to this rock. Parmenter&#8217;s
chest disappeared with the land in which it was
buried, and no man will find it now, except by
accident.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems such a shame!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;A
fortune gone to waste!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Without anyone having the fun of wasting
it!&#8221; laughed Croyden.</p>
<p>She took up Parmenter&#8217;s letter again, and
glanced over it. Then she handed it back, and
shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too much for my poor brain,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I surrender.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Precisely where we landed. We gave it rather
more than a fair trial, and, then, we gave it up.
I&#8217;m done. When I go home, to-night, I shall return
the letter to the escritoire where I found it,
and forget it. There is no profit in speculating
further.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can return it to its hiding place,&#8221; she
reflected, &#8220;but you can&#8217;t cease wondering. Why
didn&#8217;t Marmaduke Duval get the treasure while
the landmarks were there? Why did he leave it
for his heirs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably on account of old Parmenter&#8217;s restriction
that it be left until the &#8216;extremity of need.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded, in acquiescence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably,&#8221; she said, &#8220;the Duvals would regard
it as a matter of honor to observe the exact
terms of the bequest. Alas! Alas! that they
did so!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only because they did so, that I got a
chance to search!&#8221; Croyden laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean that, otherwise, there would be no
buried treasure!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Of course!&mdash;how
stupid! And with all that money, the Duvals
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
might have gone away from Hampton&mdash;might have
experienced other conditions. Colonel Duval might
never have met your father&mdash;you might have never
come to Clarendon.&mdash;My goodness! Where does it
end?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the realm of pure conjecture,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;It is idle to theorize on the might-have-beens, or
what might-have-happened if the what-did-happen
hadn&#8217;t happened. Dismiss it, at least, for this
evening. You asked what I was doing for three
weeks at Annapolis, and I have consumed a great
while in answering&mdash;let us talk of something else.
What have you been doing in those three weeks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing! A little Bridge, a few riding parties,
some sails on the Bay, with an occasional homily
by Miss Erskine, when she had me cornered, and I
couldn&#8217;t get away. Then is when I learned what
a deep impression you had made!&#8221; she laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We both were learning, it seems,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>She looked at him, inquiringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite understand,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You made an impression, also&mdash;of course, that&#8217;s
to be expected, but this impression is much more
than the ordinary kind!&#8221;</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Merci, Monsieur</i>,&#8221; she scoffed.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t <i>merci</i>, it&#8217;s a fact. And he is a
mighty good fellow on whom to make an
impression.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean, Mr.&mdash;Macloud?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so! I mean Macloud.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re very safe in saying it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wherefore?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is absent. It&#8217;s not susceptible of proof.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I think so!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;For he&#8217;s coming back&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To Hampton?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To Hampton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When?&#8221; she said, sceptically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very soon!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Delightfully indefinite!&#8221; she laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact, within a week.&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed, again!</p>
<p>&#8220;To be accurate, I expect him not later than
the day-after-to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall believe you, when I see him!&#8221; incredulously.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is, I think, coming solely on your account.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re not quite sure?&mdash;oh! modest man!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Naturally, he hasn&#8217;t confided in me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re confiding in me&mdash;how clever!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could tell some things&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which are fables.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;&mdash;but I won&#8217;t&mdash;they might turn your
head&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which way&mdash;to the right or left?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;&mdash;and make you too confident and too cruel.
He saw you but twice&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Once!&#8221; she corrected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once, on the street; again, when we called in
the evening&mdash;but he gave you a name, the instant
he saw you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How kind of him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He called you: &#8216;The Symphony in Blue.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was I in blue?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were&mdash;and looking particularly fit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was that the first time you had noticed it?&#8221;
she questioned blandly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think so?&#8221; he returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am asking you, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I impress you as being blind?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you most assuredly do not!&#8221; she laughed.</p>
<p>He looked at her with daring eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; she said, &#8220;I know you&#8217;re intrepid&mdash;but
you <i>won&#8217;t</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&mdash;why won&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because, it would be false to your friend.
You have given me to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have given you to him!&#8221; he exclaimed, with
denying intonation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!&mdash;as between you two, you have renounced,
in his favor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I protest!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At least, I so view it,&#8221; with a teasingly fascinating
smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I protest!&#8221; he repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I protest!&#8221; he reiterated.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think that you protest over-much?&#8221;
she inquired sweetly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we were two children, I&#8217;d say: &#8216;You think
you&#8217;re smart, don&#8217;t you?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;d retort: &#8216;You got left, didn&#8217;t you?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Then they both laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seriously, however&mdash;do you really expect Mr.
Macloud?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I surely do&mdash;probably within two days; and
I&#8217;m not chaffing when I say that you&#8217;re the inducement.
So, be good to him&mdash;he&#8217;s got more
than enough for two, I can assure you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mercenary!&#8221; she laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;just careful!&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what number am I&mdash;the twenty-first, or
thereabout?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What matters it, if you&#8217;re <i>the</i> one, at
present?&#8221;</p>
<p>She raised her shoulders in the slightest shrug.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d sooner be the present one than all the has-beens,&#8221;
he insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Opinions differ,&#8221; she remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it will advantage any&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say so,&#8221; she interrupted.</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;&mdash;I can tell you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Many fables, I don&#8217;t doubt!&#8221; she cut in,
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;&mdash;that we have been rather intimate, for a few
years, and I have never before known him to exhibit
particular interest in any woman.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why don&#8217;t you speak for yourself, John,&#8217;&#8221;
she quoted, merrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because, to be frank, I haven&#8217;t enough for
two,&#8221; he answered, gayly.</p>
<p>But beneath the gayety, she thought she detected
the faintest note of regret. So! there was
some one!</p>
<p>And, woman-like, when he had gone, she wondered
about her&mdash;whether she was dark or fair,
tall or small, vivacious or reserved, flirtatious or
sedate, rich or poor&mdash;and whether they loved each
other&mdash;or whether it was he, alone, who loved&mdash;or
whether he had not permitted himself to be carried
so far&mdash;or whether&mdash;then, she dropped asleep.</p>
<p>Croyden went back to Clarendon, keeping a sharp
look-out for anyone under the trees around the
house. He found Moses in the library, evidently
just aroused from slumber by the master&#8217;s door key.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one&#8217;s bin heah, seh, &#8217;cep de boy wid dis
&#8217;spatch,&#8221; he hastened to say.</p>
<p>Croyden tore open the envelope:&mdash;It was a wire
from Macloud, that he would be down to-morrow.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may go to bed, Moses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yass, seh! yass, seh!&mdash;I&#8217;se pow&#8217;ful glad yo&#8217;s
back, seh. Nothin&#8217; I kin git yo befo I goes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing!&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;You&#8217;re a good
soldier, Moses, you didn&#8217;t sleep on guard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, seh! I keps wide awake, Marster Croyden,
wide awake all de time, seh. Survent, seh!&#8221; and,
with a bow, he disappeared.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></p>
<p>Croyden finished his cigar, put out the light,
and went slowly upstairs&mdash;giving not a thought
to the Parmenter treasure nor the man he had
met outside. His mind was busy with Elaine
Cavendish&mdash;their last night on the moonlit piazza&mdash;the
brief farewell&mdash;the lingering pressure of her
fingers&mdash;the light in her eyes&mdash;the subdued pleasure,
when they met unexpectedly in Annapolis&mdash;her
little ways to detain him, keep him close to
her&mdash;her instant defense of him at Mattison&#8217;s scurrilous
insinuation&mdash;the officers&#8217; hop&mdash;the rhythmic
throb of the melody&mdash;the scented, fluttering body
held close in his arms&mdash;the lowered head&mdash;the
veiled eyes&mdash;the trembling lashes&mdash;his senses
steeped in the fragrance of her beauty&mdash;the temptation
well-nigh irresistible&mdash;his resolution almost
gone&mdash;trembling&mdash;trembling&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The vision passed&mdash;music ceased&mdash;the dance was
ended. Sentiment vanished&mdash;reason reigned once
more.</p>
<p>He was a fool! a fool! to think of her, to
dream of the past, even. But it is pleasant, sometimes,
to be a fool&mdash;where a beautiful woman is
concerned, and only one&#8217;s self to pay the piper.</p>

<h2>XIV</h2>
<h3>THE SYMPHONY IN BLUE</h3>
</div>

<p>Macloud arrived the next day, bringing for
his host a great batch of mail, which had accumulated
at the Club.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought of it at the last moment&mdash;when I
was starting for the station, in fact,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;The clerk said he had no instructions for forwarding,
so I just poked it in my bag and brought
it along. Stupid of me not to think of it sooner.
Why didn&#8217;t you mention it? I can understand why
you didn&#8217;t leave an address, but not why I shouldn&#8217;t
forward it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t care, when I left&mdash;and I don&#8217;t care
much, now&mdash;but I&#8217;m obliged, just the same!&#8221; said
Croyden. &#8220;It&#8217;s something to do; the most exciting
incident of the day, down here, is the arrival
of the mail. The people wait for it, with bated
breath. I am getting in the way, too, though I
don&#8217;t get much.... I never did have any extensive
correspondence, even in Northumberland&mdash;so this
is just circulars and such trash.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took the package, which Macloud handed him,
and tossed it on the desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s new?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Northumberland? Nothing&mdash;beyond the
usual thing. Everybody is back&mdash;everybody is hard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
up or says he is&mdash;everybody is full of lies, as usual,
and is turning them loose on anyone who will listen,
credulous or sophisticated, it makes no difference.
It&#8217;s the telling, not the believing that&#8217;s the thing.
Oh! the little cad Mattison is engaged&mdash;Charlotte
Brundage has landed him, and the wedding is set for
early next month.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t envy her the job,&#8221; Croyden remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t bother her!&#8221; Macloud laughed.
&#8220;She&#8217;ll be privileged to draw on his bank account,
and that&#8217;s the all important thing with her. He will
fracture the seventh commandment, and she won&#8217;t
turn a hair. She is a chilly proposition, all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I wish her joy of her bargain,&#8221; said
Croyden. &#8220;May she have everything she wants,
and see Mattison not at all, after the wedding
journey&mdash;and but very occasionally, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took up the letters and ran carelessly
through them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trash! Trash! Trash!&#8221; he commented, as
he consigned them, one by one, to the waste-basket.</p>
<p>Macloud watched him, languidly, behind his
cigar smoke, and made no comment.</p>
<p>Presently Croyden came to a large, white envelope&mdash;darkened
on the interior so as to prevent
the contents from being read until opened. It
bore the name of a firm of prominent brokers in
Northumberland.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! Blaxham &amp; Company!&#8221; he grunted.
&#8220;&#8216;We own and offer, subject to prior sale, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
following high grade investment bonds.&#8217; Oh yes!
I&#8217;ll take the whole bundle.&#8221; He drew out the
letter and looked at it, perfunctorily, before sending
it to rest with its fellows.&mdash;It wasn&#8217;t in the
usual form.&mdash;He opened it, wider.&mdash;It was signed
by the senior partner.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;My dear Mr. Croyden:</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a customer who is interested in the
Virginia Development Company. He has purchased
the Bonds and the stock of Royster &amp; Axtell,
from the bank which held them as collateral. He
is willing to pay you par for your Bonds, without
any accrued interest, however. If you will consent
to sell, the Company can proceed without reorganization
but, if you decline, he will foreclose
under the terms of the mortgage. We have suggested
the propriety and the economy to him&mdash;since
he owns or controls all the stock&mdash;of not
purchasing your bonds, and, frankly, have told him
it is worse than bad business to do so. But he
refuses to be advised, insisting that he must be the
sole owner, and that he is willing to submit to the
additional expense rather than go through the
tedious proceeding for foreclosure and sale. We
are prepared to honor a sight-draft with the Bonds
attached, or to pay cash on presentation and transfer.
We shall be obliged for a prompt reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;What the devil!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He read it a second time. No, he wasn&#8217;t asleep&mdash;it
was all there, typewritten and duly signed.
Two hundred thousand dollars!&mdash;honor sight draft,
or pay cash on presentation and transfer!</p>
<p>&#8220;What the devil!&#8221; he said, again. Then he
passed it across to Macloud. &#8220;Read this aloud,
will you,&mdash;I want to see if I&#8217;m quite sane!&#8221;</p>
<p>Macloud was at his favorite occupation&mdash;blowing
smoke rings through one another, and watching
them spiral upward toward the ceiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon!&#8221; he said, as Croyden&#8217;s
words roused him from his meditation. &#8220;I must
have been half asleep. What did you say&mdash;read
it?&#8221; taking the letter.</p>
<p>He and Blaxham had spent considerable time on
that letter, trying to explain the reason for the
purchase, and the foolishly high price they were
offering, in such a way as to mislead Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&mdash;aloud! I want to hear someone else
read it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Macloud looked at him, curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is typewritten, you haven&#8217;t a chance to get
wrong!&#8221; he said, wonderingly.</p>
<p>Croyden laughed!</p>
<p>&#8220;Read it, please!&#8221; he exclaimed.... &#8220;So, I
wasn&#8217;t crazy: and either Blaxham is lying or his
customer needs a guardian&mdash;which is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that it need concern you, in the
least, which it is,&#8221; said Macloud. &#8220;Be grateful for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
the offer&mdash;and accept by wireless or any other way
that&#8217;s quicker.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the bonds aren&#8217;t worth five cents on the
dollar!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So much the more reason to hustle the deal
through. Sell them! man, sell them! You may
have slipped up on the Parmenter treasure, but you
have struck it here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too rich,&#8221; Croyden answered. &#8220;There&#8217;s something
queer about that letter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Macloud smoked his cigar, and smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing queer about the letter!&#8221;&mdash;he
said. &#8220;Blaxham&#8217;s customer may have the willies&mdash;indeed,
he as much as intimates that such is the
case&mdash;but, thank God! we&#8217;re not obliged to have a
commission-in-lunacy appointed on everybody who
makes a silly stock or bond purchase. If we were,
we either would have no markets, or the courts
would have time for nothing else. No! no! old
man! take what the gods have given you and be
glad. There&#8217;s ten thousand a year in it! You can
return to Northumberland, resume the old life, and
be happy ever after;&mdash;or you can live here, and
there, and everywhere. You&#8217;re unattached&mdash;not
even a light-o&#8217;-love to squander your money, and
pester you for gowns and hats, and get in a hell
of a temper&mdash;and be false to you, besides.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t one of them, thank God!&#8221;
laughed Croyden. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got troubles enough of
my own. The present, for instance.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Troubles!&#8221; marvelled Macloud. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t
any troubles, now. This clears them all away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It clears some of them away&mdash;if I take it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thunder! man, you&#8217;re not thinking, seriously,
of refusing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will put me on &#8216;easy street,&#8217;&#8221; Croyden observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, why hesitate an instant?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And it comes with remarkable timeliness&mdash;so
timely, indeed, as to be suspicious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suspicious? Why suspicious? It&#8217;s a bona
fide offer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bona fide offer&mdash;there&#8217;s no trouble on
that score.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, what is the trouble?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; said Croyden: &#8220;I&#8217;m broke&mdash;finally.
The Parmenter treasure is moonshine, so far as
I&#8217;m concerned. I&#8217;m down on my uppers, so to
speak&mdash;my only assets are some worthless bonds.
Behold! along comes an offer for them at par&mdash;two
hundred thousand dollars for nothing! I
fancy, old man, there is a friend back of this offer&mdash;the
only friend I have in the world&mdash;and I did
not think that even he was kind and self-sacrificing
enough to do it.&mdash;I&#8217;m grateful, Colin, grateful from
the heart, believe me, but I can&#8217;t take your money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My money!&#8221; exclaimed Macloud&mdash;&#8220;you do me
too much credit, Croyden. I&#8217;m ashamed to admit it,
but I never thought of the bonds, or of helping
you out, in your trouble. It&#8217;s a way we have in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
Northumberland. We may feel for misfortune,
but it rarely gets as far as our pockets. Don&#8217;t
imagine for a moment that I&#8217;m the purchaser. I&#8217;m
not, though I wish, now, that I was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you give me your word on that?&#8221; Croyden
demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I most assuredly will,&#8221; Macloud answered.</p>
<p>Croyden nodded. He was satisfied.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no one else!&#8221; he mused, &#8220;no one
else!&#8221; He looked at the letter again.... &#8220;And,
yet, it is very suspicious, very suspicious.... I
wonder, could I ascertain the name of the purchaser
of the stocks and bonds, from the Trust
Company who held them as collateral?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Macloud. &#8220;Blaxham
&amp; Company bought them at the public sale.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could try the transfer agent, or the registrar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They never tell anything, as you are aware,&#8221;
Macloud replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could refuse to sell unless Blaxham &amp; Company
disclosed their customer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you could&mdash;and, likely, lose the sale; they
won&#8217;t disclose. However, that&#8217;s your business,&#8221;
Macloud observed; &#8220;though, it&#8217;s a pity to tilt at
windmills, for a foolish notion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden creased and uncreased the letter&mdash;thinking.</p>
<p>Macloud resumed the smoke rings&mdash;and waited.
It had proved easier than he had anticipated. Croyden
had not once thought of Elaine Cavendish&mdash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
his simple word had been sufficient to clear
himself....</p>
<p>At length, Croyden put the letter back in its
envelope and looked up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll sell the bonds,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;forward them at
once with draft attached, if you will witness my
signature to the transfer. But it&#8217;s a queer proceeding,
a queer proceeding: paying good money
for bad!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s his business&mdash;not yours,&#8221; said Macloud,
easily.</p>
<p>Croyden went to the escritoire and took the bonds
from one of the drawers.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can judge, from the place I keep them,
how much I thought them worth!&#8221; he laughed.</p>
<p>When they were duly transferred and witnessed,
Croyden attached a draft drawn on an ordinary
sheet of paper, dated Northumberland, and payable
to his account at the Tuscarora Trust Company.
He placed them in an envelope, sealed it and, enclosing
it in a second envelope, passed it over to
Macloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care to inform them as to my whereabouts,&#8221;
he remarked, &#8220;so, if you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;ll
trouble you to address this to some one in New
York or Philadelphia, with a request that he mail
the enclosed envelope for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Macloud, when he had done as requested, laid
aside the pen and looked inquiringly at Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which, being interpreted,&#8221; he said, &#8220;might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
mean that you don&#8217;t intend to return to Northumberland.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The interpretation does not go quite so far;
it means, simply, that I have not decided.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to come back?&#8221; Macloud
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a question of resolution, not of inclination,&#8221;
Croyden answered. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether I&#8217;ve
sufficient resolution to go, and sufficient resolution
to stay, if I do go. It may be easier not to go,
at all&mdash;to live here, and wander, elsewhere, when
the spirit moves.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Macloud understood. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking
over the proposition you recently advanced of the
folly of a relatively poor man marrying a rich
girl,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and you&#8217;re all wrong. It&#8217;s a
question of the respective pair, not a theory that
can be generalized over. I admit, the man should
not be a pauper, but, if he have enough money to
support <i>himself</i>, and the girl love him and he loves
the girl, the fact that she has gobs more money,
won&#8217;t send them on the rocks. It&#8217;s up to the pair,
I repeat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning, that it would be up to Elaine
Cavendish and me?&#8221; answered Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you please, yes!&#8221; said Macloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could be so sure,&#8221; Croyden reflected.
&#8220;Sure of the girl, as well as sure of myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doubtful about&mdash;yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden laughed, a trifle self-consciously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I fancy I could manage myself,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Elaine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Elaine!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Try her!&mdash;she&#8217;s worth the try.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From a monetary standpoint?&#8221; smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get the miserable money out of your mind a
moment, will you?&mdash;you&#8217;re hipped on it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, old man, anything for peace! Tell
me, did you see her, when you were home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did&mdash;I dined with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who else was there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;she talked Croyden at least seven-eighths
of the time; I, the other eighth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Must have been an interesting conversation.
Anything left of the victim, afterward?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I refuse to become facetious,&#8221; Macloud responded.
Then he threw his cigar into the grate
and arose. &#8220;It matters not what was said, nor who
said it! If you will permit me the advice, you will
take your chance while you have it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have I a&mdash;chance?&#8221; Croyden asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have&mdash;more than a chance, if you act,
now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He walked across to the window. He
would let that sink in.&mdash;&#8220;How&#8217;s the Symphony in
Blue?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;As charming as ever&mdash;and prepared for your
coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As charming as ever, and prepared for your
coming.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Some of your work!&#8221; he commented. &#8220;Did
you propose for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I left that finality for you&mdash;being the person
most interested.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks! you&#8217;re exceedingly considerate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you would appreciate it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When did you arrange for me to go over?&#8221;
asked Macloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any time&mdash;the sooner the quicker. She&#8217;ll be
glad to see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She confided in you, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not directly; she let me infer it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In other words, you worked your imagination&mdash;overtime!&#8221;
laughed Macloud. &#8220;It&#8217;s a pity you
couldn&#8217;t work it a bit over the Parmenter jewels.
You might locate them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m done with the Parmenter jewels!&#8221; said
Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;But they&#8217;re not done with you, my friend. So
long as you live, they&#8217;ll be present with you.
You&#8217;ll be hunting for them in your dreams.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meet me to-night in dream-land!&#8221; sang Croyden.
&#8220;Well, they&#8217;re not likely to disturb my
slumbers&mdash;unless&mdash;there was a rather queer thing
happened, last night, Colin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!&mdash;I got in to Hampton, in the evening;
about nine o&#8217;clock, I was returning to Clarendon
when, at the gates, I was accosted by a tall, well-dressed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
stranger. Here is the substance of our talk....
What do you make of it?&#8221; he
ended.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me the fellow made it very plain,&#8221;
Macloud returned, &#8220;except on one possible point.
He evidently believes we found the treasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is convinced of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, he knows that you came direct from
Annapolis to Hampton&mdash;I mean, you didn&#8217;t visit a
bank nor other place where you could have deposited
the jewels. Ergo, the jewels are still in
your possession, according to his theory, and he
is going to make a try for them while they are within
reach. Informing the Government is a bluff. He
hoped, by that means, to induce you to keep the
jewels on the premises&mdash;not to make evidence
against yourself, which could be traced by the
United States, by depositing them in any bank.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t I have taken them to a dealer in
precious stones?&#8221; said Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because that would make the best sort of evidence
against you. You must remember, he thinks
you have the jewels, and that you will try to conceal
it, pending a Government investigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You make him a very canny gentleman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;I make him only a clever rogue, which,
by your own account, he is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the more clever he is, the more he will
have his wits&#8217; work for naught. There&#8217;s some
compensation in everything&mdash;even in failure!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It would be a bit annoying,&#8221; observed Macloud,
&#8220;to be visited by burglars, who are obsessed with
the idea that you have a fortune concealed on the
premises, and are bent on obtaining it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Annoying?&mdash;not a bit!&#8221; smiled Croyden. &#8220;I
should rather enjoy the sport of putting them to
flight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or of being bound, and gagged, and ill-treated.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bosh! you&#8217;ve transferred your robber-barons
from Northumberland to the Eastern Shore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t!&#8221; laughed Macloud. &#8220;The
robber-barons were still on the job in Northumberland.
These are banditti, disguised as burglars,
about to hold you up for ransom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I had your fine imagination,&#8221; scoffed
Croyden. &#8220;I could make a fortune writing fiction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re not so bad yourself!&#8221; Macloud retorted.
Then he smiled. &#8220;Apropos of fortunes!&#8221;
and nodded toward the envelope on the table. &#8220;It&#8217;s
bully good to think you&#8217;re coming back to us!&#8221;</p>
<p>At that moment Moses passed along the hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, Moses,&#8221; said Croyden, &#8220;take this letter
down to the post office&mdash;I want it to catch the
first mail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I fancy you haven&#8217;t heard of the stranger
since last evening?&#8221; Macloud asked.</p>
<p>Croyden shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;And of course you haven&#8217;t told any one?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have!&#8221; said Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;A woman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How strange!&#8221; commented Macloud, mockingly.
&#8220;I suppose you even told her the entire
story&mdash;from the finding of the letter down to
date.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did!&mdash;and showed her the letter besides. Why
shouldn&#8217;t I have done it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No reason in the world, my dear fellow&mdash;except
that in twenty-four hours the dear public
will know it, and we shall be town curiosities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have to remain,&#8221; said Croyden, with
affected seriousness&mdash;&#8220;there are trains out, you
know, as well as in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to go away&mdash;I came here to
visit you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will go together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we can&#8217;t take the Symphony in Blue!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! that&#8217;s it!&#8221; Croyden laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, that&#8217;s it! You don&#8217;t think I came
down here to see only you, after having just spent
nearly four weeks with you, in that fool quest on
Greenberry Point?&#8221; He turned, suddenly, and
faced Croyden. &#8220;Who was the woman you told?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Carrington!&#8221; Croyden laughed. &#8220;Think
she will retail it to the dear public?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, go to thunder!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because, if you do, you might mention it
to her&mdash;there, she goes, now!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; said Macloud, whirling around
toward the window.</p>
<p>Croyden made no reply. It was not necessary.
On the opposite side of the street, Miss Carrington&mdash;in
a tailored gown of blue broadcloth, close fitting
and short in the skirt, with a velvet toque
to match&mdash;was swinging briskly back from town.</p>
<p>Macloud watched her a moment in silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;The old man is done for, at last!&#8221; Croyden
thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t she a corker!&#8221; Macloud broke out.
&#8220;Look at the poise of the head, and ease of
carriage, and the way she puts down her feet!&mdash;that&#8217;s
the way to tell a woman. God! Croyden,
she&#8217;s thoroughbred!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You better go over,&#8221; said his friend. &#8220;It&#8217;s
about the tea hour, she&#8217;ll brew you a cup.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll drink it&mdash;as much as she will give
me. I despise the stuff, but I&#8217;ll drink it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll put rum in it, if you prefer!&#8221; laughed
Croyden; &#8220;or make you a high ball, or you can
have it straight&mdash;just as you want.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along!&#8221; exclaimed Macloud. &#8220;We&#8217;re
wasting time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be over, presently,&#8221; Croyden replied. &#8220;<i>I</i>
don&#8217;t want any tea, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; Macloud answered, from the hallway.
&#8220;Come along, as soon as you wish&mdash;but
don&#8217;t come <i>too soon</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Macloud found Miss Carrington plucking a few
belated roses, which, somehow, had escaped the
frost.</p>
<p>She looked up at his approach, and smiled&mdash;the
bewilderingly bewitching smile which lighted
her whole countenance and seemed to say so much.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back again! to Clarendon and its master?&#8221;
was her greeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;And, if I may, to you,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good! After them, you belong to <i>me</i>,&#8221;
she laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why after?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;it was the order of speech, and
the order of acquaintance,&#8221; with a naive look.</p>
<p>&#8220;But not the order of&mdash;regard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Content!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;You did it very
well for a&mdash;novice.&#8221;</p>
<p>He tapped the gray hair upon his temples.</p>
<p>&#8220;A novice?&#8221; he inflected.</p>
<p>&#8220;You decline to accept it?&mdash;Very well, sir, very
well!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t accept, and be honest,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you must be honest! Oh, brave man!
Oh, noble gentleman! Perchance, you will accept
a reward: a cup of tea&mdash;or a high ball!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Perchance, I will&mdash;the high ball!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought so! come along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were not going out?&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him, with a sly smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know that I have just returned,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I saw you in the window at Clarendon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was there,&#8221; he admitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you came over at once&mdash;prepared to be
surprised that I was here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And found you waiting for me&mdash;just as I
expected.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;You&#8217;re horrid! perfectly
horrid!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Peccavi! Peccavi!</i>&#8221; he said humbly.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Te absolvo!</i>&#8221; she replied, solemnly. &#8220;Now, let
us make a fresh start&mdash;by going for a walk. You
can postpone the high ball until we return.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can postpone the high ball for ever,&#8221; he
averred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning, you could walk forever, or you&#8217;re
not thirsty?&#8221; she laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning, I could walk forever <i>with you</i>&mdash;on,
and on, and on&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Until you walked into the Bay&mdash;I understand.
I&#8217;ll take the will for the deed&mdash;the water&#8217;s rather
chilly at this season of the year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Macloud held up his hand, in mock despair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us make a third start&mdash;drop the attempt
to be clever and talk sense. I think I can do it,
if I try.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Willingly!&#8221; she responded.</p>
<p>As they came out on the side walk, Croyden was
going down the street. He crossed over and met
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve not forgot your admonition, so don&#8217;t be
uneasy,&#8221; he observed to Macloud. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to
town now, I&#8217;ll be back in about half an hour&mdash;is
that too soon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite soon enough!&#8221; was the answer.</p>
<p>Miss Carrington looked at Macloud, quizzically,
but made no comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we take the regulation walk?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;The what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The regulation walk&mdash;to the Cemetery and
back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad we&#8217;re coming back?&#8221; he laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the favorite walk, here,&#8221; she explained&mdash;&#8220;the
most picturesque and the smoothest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To say nothing of accustoming the people to
their future home,&#8221; Macloud remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not used to the ways of small towns&mdash;the
Cemetery is a resort, a place to spend a while,
a place to visit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does it make death any easier to hob-nob with
it?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t think so,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;However,
I can see how it would induce morbidity, though
there are those who are happiest only when they&#8217;re
miserable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Such people ought to live in a morgue,&#8221; agreed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
Macloud. &#8220;However we&#8217;re safe enough&mdash;we can
go to the Cemetery with impunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are some rather queer old headstones,
out there,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Remorse and the inevitable
pay-up for earthly transgression seem to be the
leading subjects. There is one in the Duval lot&mdash;the
Duvals from whom Mr. Croyden got
Clarendon, you know&mdash;and I never have been able
to understand just what it means. It is erected
to the memory of one Robert Parmenter, and has
cut in the slab the legend: &#8216;He feared nor man, nor
god, nor devil,&#8217; and below it, a man on his knees
making supplication to one standing over him.
If he feared nor man, nor god, nor devil, why
should he be imploring mercy from any one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know who Parmenter was?&#8221; said
Macloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;but I presume a connection of the family,
from having been buried with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You read his letter only last evening&mdash;his
letter to Marmaduke Duval.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His letter to Marmaduke Duval!&#8221; she repeated.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t read any&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Robert Parmenter is the pirate who buried
the treasure on Greenberry Point,&#8221; he interrupted.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, a light broke in on her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see!&mdash;I didn&#8217;t look at the name signed to
the letter. And the cutting on the tombstone&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is a victim begging mercy from him,&#8221; said
Macloud. &#8220;I like that Marmaduke Duval&mdash;there&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
something fine in a man, in those times, bringing
the old buccaneer over from Annapolis and burying
him beside the place where he, himself, some day
would rest.&mdash;That is friendship!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that is like the Duvals!&#8221; said she. &#8220;It
was a sad day in Hampton when the Colonel died.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He left a good deputy,&#8221; Macloud replied.
&#8220;Croyden is well-born and well-bred (the former
does not always comprehend the latter, these days),
and of Southern blood on his mother&#8217;s side.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which hasn&#8217;t hurt him with us!&#8221; she smiled.
&#8220;We are a bit clannish, still.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Delighted to hear you confess it! I&#8217;ve got a
little of it myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Southern blood?&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded. &#8220;Mine doesn&#8217;t go so far South,
however, as Croyden&#8217;s&mdash;only, to Virginia.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew it! I knew there was some reason
for my liking you!&#8221; she laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I find any other reason?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Than your Southern ancestors?&mdash;isn&#8217;t that
enough?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if there be a means to increase it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Southern blood is never satisfied with <i>some</i>
things&mdash;it always wants more!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the disposition to want more, in Southerners,
confined to the male sex?&#8221; he laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;In <i>some things</i>&mdash;yes, unquestionably yes!&#8221; she
retorted. Then changed the subject. &#8220;Has Mr.
Croyden told you of his experience, last evening?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></p>
<p>&#8220;With the stranger, yes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think he is in danger?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What possible danger could there be&mdash;the
treasure isn&#8217;t at Clarendon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they think it is&mdash;and desperate men sometimes
take desperate means, when they feel sure
that money is hidden on the premises.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a town the size of Hampton, every stranger
is known.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How will that advantage, in the prevention
of the crime?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;By making it difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t need stay in the town&mdash;they can
come in an automobile.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They could also drive, or walk, or come by
boat,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are not so likely to try it if there are
two in the house. Do you intend to remain at
Clarendon some time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It depends&mdash;on how you treat me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I engage to be nice for&mdash;two weeks!&#8221; she
smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Done!&mdash;I&#8217;m booked for two weeks, at least.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And when the two weeks have expired we shall
consider whether to extend the period.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To&mdash;life?&#8221; smiling down at her.</p>
<p>She flung him a look that was delightfully alluring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you wish me to&mdash;consider that?&#8221; she asked,
softly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If you will,&#8221; he said, bending down.</p>
<p>She laughed, gayly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are coming on!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;This
pace is getting rather brisk&mdash;did you notice it,
Mr. Macloud?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re in a fast class, Miss Carrington.&#8221;</p>
<p>She glanced up quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t misunderstand me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were speaking in the language of the
race track, I presume.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was&mdash;you understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A Southern girl usually loves&mdash;horses,&#8221; with
a tantalizing smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is well for you this is a public street,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; she asked, with assumed innocence.</p>
<p>&#8220;But then if it hadn&#8217;t been, you would not
have ventured to tempt me,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I&#8217;m grateful
for the temptation, at any rate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His first temptation!&#8221; she mocked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not likely&mdash;but his first that he has
resisted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And why did you resist? The fact that we
are on a public street would not restrain you.
There was absolutely no one within sight&mdash;and
you knew it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do <i>you</i> know it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I looked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were afraid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all!&mdash;only careful.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This is rather faster than the former going!&#8221;
he laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We would better slow down a bit!&#8221; she laughed
back. &#8220;Any way, here is the Cemetery, and we
dare not go faster than a walk in it. Yonder,
just within the gates, is the Duval burial place.
Come, I&#8217;ll show you Parmenter&#8217;s grave?&#8221;</p>
<p>They crossed to it&mdash;marked by a blue slate slab,
which covered it entirely. The inscription, cut in
script, was faint in places and blurred by moss,
in others.</p>
<p>Macloud stooped and, with his knife, scratched
out the latter.</p>
<p>&#8220;He died two days after the letter was written:
May 12, 1738,&#8221; said he. &#8220;His age is not given.
Duval did not know it, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See, here is the picture&mdash;it stands out very
plainly,&#8221; said Miss Carrington, indicating with the
point of her shoe.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not given to moralizing, particularly over
a grave,&#8221; observed Macloud, &#8220;but it&#8217;s queer to
think that the old pirate, who had so much blood
and death on his hands, who buried the treasure,
and who wrote the letter, lies at our feet; and
we&mdash;or rather Croyden is the heir of that
treasure, and that we searched and dug all over
Greenberry Point, committed violence, were threatened
with violence, did things surreptitiously, are
threatened, anew, with blackmail and violence&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pirate&#8217;s gold breeds pirate&#8217;s ways,&#8221; she quoted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It does seem one cannot get away from its
pollution. It was gathered in crime and crime
clings to it, still. However, I fancy Croyden
would willingly chance the danger, if he could unearth
the casket.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And is there no hope of finding it?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolutely none&mdash;there&#8217;s half a million over on
Greenberry Point, or in the water close by, and
none will ever see it&mdash;except by accident.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What sort of accident?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know!&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;My own idea&mdash;and
Croyden&#8217;s (as he has, doubtless, explained to
you) is that the place, where Parmenter buried
the jewels, is now under water, possibly close to
the shore. We dragged every inch of the bottom,
which has been washed away to a depth more than
sufficient to uncover the iron box, but found nothing.
A great storm, such as they say sometimes
breaks over the Chesapeake, may wash it on the
beach&mdash;that, I think, is the only way it will ever
be found.... It makes everything seem very real
to have stood by Parmenter&#8217;s grave!&#8221; he said,
thoughtful, as they turned back toward town.</p>
<p>On nearing the Carrington house, they saw
Croyden approaching. They met him at the gates.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been communing with Parmenter,&#8221; said
Macloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know there was a spiritualistic medium
in Hampton! What does the old man look like?&#8221;
smiled Croyden.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, did he help you to locate his jewel box?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He wasn&#8217;t especially communicative&mdash;he was in
his grave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t surprising&mdash;he&#8217;s been dead something
over one hundred and seventy years. Did
he confide where he&#8217;s buried?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s buried with the Duvals in the Cemetery,
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is!&#8221; Croyden exclaimed. &#8220;Humph! one
more circumstance to prove the letter speaks the
truth. Everything but the thing itself. We find
his will, probated with Marmaduke Duval as
executor, we even discover a notice of his death
in the <i>Gazette</i>, and now, finally, you find his body&mdash;or
the place of its interment! But, hang it
all! what is really worth while, we can&#8217;t find.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come into the house&mdash;I&#8217;ll give you something
to soothe your feelings temporarily,&#8221; said Miss
Carrington.</p>
<p>They encountered Miss Erskine just coming
from the library on her way to the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Davila, so glad to see you!&#8221; she
exclaimed. &#8220;And Mr. Croyden, we thought you
had deserted us, and just when we&#8217;re trying to
make you feel at home. So glad to welcome you
back!&#8221; holding out her fat hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m delighted to be back,&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;The
Carringtons seemed genuinely glad to see me&mdash;and,
now, if I may include you, I&#8217;m quite content
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
to return,&#8221; and he shook her hand, as though he
meant it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you may believe it,&#8221; with an inane
giggle. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to bring my art class over to
Clarendon to revel in your treasures, some day,
soon. You&#8217;ll be at home to them, won&#8217;t you,
dear Mr. Croyden?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely! I shall take pleasure in being at
home,&#8221; Croyden replied, soberly.</p>
<p>Then Macloud, who was talking with the Captain,
was called over and presented, that being,
Miss Carrington thought, the quickest method of
getting rid of her. The evident intention to remain
until he was presented, being made entirely
obvious by Miss Erskine, who, after she had bubbled
a bit more, departed.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is her name, I didn&#8217;t catch it?&mdash;and&#8221;
(observing smiles on Croyden and Miss Carrington&#8217;s
faces) &#8220;what is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think father can explain, in more appropriate
language!&#8221; Miss Carrington laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s the most intolerable nuisance and greatest
fool in Hampton!&#8221; Captain Carrington exploded.</p>
<p>&#8220;A red flag to a bull isn&#8217;t in it with Miss
Erskine and father,&#8221; Miss Carrington observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I hide it pretty well&mdash;while she&#8217;s here,&#8221;
he protested.</p>
<p>&#8220;If she&#8217;s not here too long&mdash;and you can get
away, in time.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the two men left the Carrington place,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
darkness had fallen. As they approached Clarendon,
the welcoming brightness of a well-lighted
house sprang out to greet them. It was Croyden&#8217;s
one extravagance&mdash;to have plenty of illumination.
He had always been accustomed to it, and the
gloom, at night, of the village residence, bright
only in library or living room&mdash;with, maybe, a
timid taper in the hall&mdash;set his nerves on edge.
He would have none of it. And Moses, with considerable
wonder at, to his mind, the waste of
gas, and much grumbling to himself and Josephine,
obeyed.</p>
<p>They had finished dinner and were smoking their
cigars in the library, when Croyden, suddenly bethinking
himself of a matter which he had forgotten,
arose and pulled the bell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Survent, seh!&#8221; said old Mose a moment later
from the doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moses, who is the best carpenter in town?&#8221;
Croyden asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mistah Snyder, seh&mdash;he wuz heah dis arfternoon,
yo knows, seh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know it,&#8221; said Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why yo sont &#8217;im, seh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> sent him! I don&#8217;t know the man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s mons&#8217;us &#8217;culiar, seh&mdash;he said yo sont
&#8217;im. He com&#8217;d &#8217;torrectly arfter yo lef! Him an&#8217;
a&#8217;nudder man, seh&mdash;I didn&#8217;t know the nudder man,
hows&#8217;ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did they want?&#8221; Croyden asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Dey sed yo warn dem to look over all de place,
seh, an&#8217; see what repairs wuz necessary, and fix dem.
Dey wuz heah a&#8217;most two hours, I s&#8217;pose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is most extraordinary!&#8221; Croyden exclaimed.
&#8220;Do you mean they were in this house
for two hours?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yass, seh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What were they doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Zaminin the furniture everywhere. I didn&#8217;t
stays wid em, seh&mdash;I knows Mistah Snyder well;
he&#8217;s bin heah off&#8217;n to wuk befo&#8217; yo cum, seh. But
I seed dem gwine th&#8217;oo de drawers, an&#8217; poundin on
the floohs, seh. Dey went down to de cellar, too,
seh, an wuz dyar quite a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure it was Snyder?&#8221; Croyden asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sut&#8217;n&#8217;y! seh, don&#8217;t you t&#8217;inks I knows &#8217;im? I
knows &#8217;im from de time he wuz so high.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden nodded. &#8220;Go down and tell Snyder I
want to see him, either to-night or in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>The negro bowed, and departed.</p>
<p>Croyden got up and went to the escritoire: the
drawers were in confusion. He glanced at the
book-cases: the books were disarranged. He turned
and looked, questioningly, at Macloud&mdash;and a
smile slowly overspread his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the tall gentleman has visited us!&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wondered how long you would be coming
to it!&#8221; Macloud remarked. &#8220;It&#8217;s the old ruse,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
in a slightly modified form. Instead of a telephone
or gas inspector, it was a workman whom the
servant knew; a little more trouble in disguising
himself, but vastly more satisfactory in results.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are clever rogues,&#8221; said Croyden&mdash;&#8220;and
the disguise must have been pretty accurate to
deceive Moses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Disguise is their business,&#8221; Macloud replied, laconically.
&#8220;If they&#8217;re not proficient in it, they
go to prison&mdash;sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if they <i>are</i> proficient, they go&mdash;sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly!&mdash;sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll make a tour of inspection&mdash;they couldn&#8217;t
find what they wanted, so we&#8217;ll see what they took.&#8221;</p>
<p>They went over the house. Every drawer was
turned upside down, every closet awry, every place,
where the jewels could be concealed, bore evidence
of having been inspected&mdash;nothing, apparently, had
been missed. They had gone through the house
completely, even into the garret, where every board
that was loose had evidently been taken up and
replaced&mdash;some of them carelessly.</p>
<p>Not a thing was gone, so far as Croyden could
judge&mdash;possibly, because there was no money in
the house; probably, because they were looking for
jewels, and scorned anything of moderate value.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, this thing grows interesting&mdash;if it were
not so ridiculous,&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;I&#8217;m willing
to go to almost any trouble to convince them I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
haven&#8217;t the treasure&mdash;just to be rid of them. I
wonder what they will try next?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Abduction, maybe,&#8221; Macloud suggested.
&#8220;Some night a black cloth will be thrown over
your head, you&#8217;ll be tossed into a cab&mdash;I mean,
an automobile&mdash;and borne off for ransom like
Charlie Ross of fading memory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Moral&mdash;don&#8217;t venture out after sunset!&#8221;
laughed Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;And don&#8217;t venture out at any time without a
revolver handy and a good pair of legs,&#8221; added
Macloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can work the legs better than I can the
revolver.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or, to make sure, you might have a guard
of honor and a gatling gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re appointed to the position&mdash;provide
yourself with the gun!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, seriously!&#8221; said Macloud, &#8220;it would be
well to take some precaution. They seem obsessed
with the idea that you have the jewels, here&mdash;and
they evidently intend to get a share, if it&#8217;s
possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What precaution, for instance?&#8221; scoffed
Croyden.</p>
<p>Macloud shrugged his shoulders, helplessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I knew,&#8221; he said.</p>

<h2>XVI</h2>
<h3>THE MARABOU MUFF</h3>
</div>

<p>The next two weeks passed uneventfully. The
thieves did not manifest themselves, and the Government
authorities did nothing to suggest that
they had been informed of the Parmenter treasure.</p>
<p>Macloud had developed an increasing fondness
for Miss Carrington&#8217;s society, which she, on her
part, seemed to accept with placid equanimity.
They rode, they drove, they walked, they sailed
when the weather warranted&mdash;and the weather had
recovered from its fit of the blues, and was lazy
and warm and languid. In short, they did everything
which is commonly supposed to denote a
growing fondness for each other.</p>
<p>Croyden had been paid promptly for the Virginia
Development Company bonds, and was once more
on &#8220;comfortable street,&#8221; as he expressed it. But
he spoke no word of returning to Northumberland.
On the contrary, he settled down to enjoy the life
of the village, social and otherwise. He was nice
to all the girls, but showed a marked preference
for Miss Carrington; which, however, did not
trouble his friend, in the least.</p>
<p>Macloud was quite willing to run the risk with
Croyden. He was confident that the call of the
old life, the memory of the girl that was, and that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
was still, would be enough to hold Geoffrey from
more than firm friendship. He was not quite sure
of himself, however&mdash;that he wanted to marry.
And he was entirely sure she had not decided
whether she wanted him&mdash;that was what gave him
his lease of life; if she decided <i>for</i> him, he knew
that he would decide for her&mdash;and quickly.</p>
<p>Then, one day, came a letter&mdash;forwarded by the
Club, where he had left his address with instructions
that it be divulged to no one. It was dated
Northumberland, and read:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;My dear Colin&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is useless, between us, to dissemble, and I&#8217;m
not going to try it. I want to know whether
Geoffrey Croyden is coming back to Northumberland?
You are with him, and should know. You
can tell his inclination. You can ask him, if necessary.
If he is not coming and there is no one
else&mdash;won&#8217;t you tell me where you are? (I don&#8217;t
ask you to reveal his address, you see.) I shall
come down&mdash;if only for an hour, between trains&mdash;and
give him his chance. It is radically improper,
according to accepted notions&mdash;but notions don&#8217;t
bother me, when they stand (as I am sure they
do, in this case), in the way of happiness.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style=' margin-right:10em;'>&#8220;Sincerely,</p>
<p style=' margin-right:2em;'>&#8220;Elaine Cavendish.&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>At dinner, Macloud casually remarked:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I ought to go out to Northumberland, this
week, for a short time, won&#8217;t you go along?&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going back to Northumberland,&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean to stay!&#8221; Macloud interposed.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll promise to come back with you in two days
at the most.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose you will!&#8221; Croyden smiled.
&#8220;You can easily find your way back. For me,
it&#8217;s easier to stay away from Northumberland, than
to go away from it, <i>again</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Macloud, being wise, dropped the conversation,
saying only:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I may not have to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>A little later, as he sat in the drawing-room at
Carringtons&#8217;, he broached a matter which had been
on his mind for some time&mdash;working around to it
gradually, with Croyden the burden of their talk.
When his opportunity came&mdash;as it was bound to
do&mdash;he took it without hesitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Croyden had
two reasons for leaving Northumberland: one of
them has been eliminated; the other is stronger
than ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him, shrewdly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And that other is a woman?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>He nodded. &#8220;A woman who has plenty of
money&mdash;more than she can ever spend, indeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And in looks?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The only one who can approach yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Altogether, most desirable!&#8221; she laughed.
&#8220;What was the trouble&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t she have him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t ask her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Useless?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything but useless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean she was willing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Croyden?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More than willing, I take it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, what was the difficulty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her money&mdash;she has so much!&mdash;So much, that,
in comparison, he is a mere pauper:&mdash;twenty
millions against two hundred thousand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If she be willing, I can&#8217;t see why he is shy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He says it is all right for a poor girl to
marry a rich man, but not for a poor man to
marry a rich girl. His idea is, that the husband
should be able to maintain his wife according to
her condition. To marry else, he says, is giving
hostages to fortune, and is derogatory to that
mutual respect which should exist between them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We all give hostages to fortune when we
marry!&#8221; Miss Carrington exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not all!&#8221; replied Macloud, meaningly.</p>
<p>She flushed slightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it you want me to do?&#8221; she asked
hastily&mdash;&#8220;or can I do anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;You can ask Miss
Cavendish to visit you for a few days.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Can you, by any possibility, mean Elaine
Cavendish?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly who I do mean&mdash;do you know
her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After a fashion&mdash;we went to Dobbs Ferry together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bully!&#8221; exclaimed Macloud. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t
you tell me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You never mentioned her before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True!&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;This is fortunate, very
fortunate! Will you ask her down?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She will think it a trifle peculiar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary, she&#8217;ll think it more than
kind&mdash;a positive favor. You see, she knows I&#8217;m
with Croyden, but she doesn&#8217;t know where; so
she wrote to me at my Club and they forwarded
it. Croyden left Northumberland without a word&mdash;and
no one is aware of his residence but me.
She asks that I tell her where <i>I</i> am. Then she
intends to come down and give Croyden a last
chance. I want to help her&mdash;and your invitation
will be right to the point&mdash;she&#8217;ll jump at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a good friend!&#8221; she reflected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you do it?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>She thought a moment before she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it!&#8221; she said at length. &#8220;Come, we&#8217;ll
work out the letter together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would I not be permitted to kiss you as Miss
Cavendish&#8217;s deputy?&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Cavendish can be her own deputy,&#8221; she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
answered.&mdash;&#8220;Moreover, it would be premature.&#8221;</p>
<p>The second morning after, when Elaine Cavendish&#8217;s
maid brought her breakfast, Miss Carrington&#8217;s
letter was on the tray among tradesmen&#8217;s circulars,
invitations, and friendly correspondence.</p>
<p>She did not recognize the handwriting, and the
postmark was unfamiliar, wherefore, coupled with
the fact that it was addressed in a particularly
stylish hand, she opened it first. It was very brief,
very succinct, very informing, and very satisfactory.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<div class='ce'>
<p>&#8220;Ashburton,</p>
<p>&#8220;Hampton, Md.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;My dear Elaine:&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Macloud tells me you are contemplating
coming down to the Eastern Shore to look for a
country-place. Let me advise Hampton&mdash;there are
some delightful old residences in this vicinity which
positively are crying for a purchaser. Geoffrey
Croyden, whom you know, I believe, is resident
here, and is thinking of making it his home permanently.
If you can be persuaded to come, you
are to stay with me&mdash;the hotels are simply impossible,
and I shall be more than delighted to
have you. We can talk over old times at Dobbs,
and have a nice little visit together. Don&#8217;t trouble
to write&mdash;just wire the time of your arrival&mdash;and
come before the good weather departs. Don&#8217;t
disappoint me.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style=' margin-right:10em;'>&#8220;With lots of love,</p>
<p style=' margin-right:2em;'>&#8220;Davila Carrington.&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></div>
<p>Elaine Cavendish read the letter slowly&mdash;and
smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clever! very clever!&#8221; she mused. &#8220;Colin is
rather a diplomat&mdash;he managed it with exceeding
adroitness&mdash;and the letter is admirably worded.
It tells me everything I wanted to know. I&#8217;d
forgotten about Davila Carrington, and I reckon
she had forgotten me, till he somehow found it out
and jogged her memory. Surely! I shall accept.&#8221;</p>
<p>To-morrow would be Thursday. She went to
her desk and wrote this wire, in answer:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Miss Davila Carrington,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Hampton, Md.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be with you Friday, on morning train.
You&#8217;re very, very kind.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style=' margin-right:2em;'>&#8220;Elaine Cavendish.&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>Miss Carrington showed the wire to Macloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I&#8217;ve done all that I can; the rest is in
your hands,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll coöperate, but you
are the general.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Until Elaine comes&mdash;she will manage it then,&#8221;
Macloud answered.</p>
<p>And on Friday morning, a little before noon,
Miss Cavendish arrived. Miss Carrington, alone,
met her at the station.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re just the same Davila I&#8217;d forgotten for
years,&#8221; said she, laughingly, as they walked across
the platform to the waiting carriage.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re the same I had forgotten,&#8221; Davila
replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s delightful to be remembered!&#8221; said
Elaine, meaningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s just as delightful to be able to remember,&#8221;
was the reply.</p>
<p>Just after they left the business section, on the
drive out, Miss Carrington saw Croyden and
Macloud coming down the street. Evidently Macloud
had not been able to detain him at home until
she got her charge safely into Ashburton. She
glanced at Miss Cavendish&mdash;she had seen them,
also, and, settling back into the corner of the
phaeton, she hid her face with her Marabou muff.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t stop!&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Miss Carrington smiled her understanding.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t!&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Good morning!&#8221;
as both men raised their hats&mdash;and drove straight
on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was the girl with Miss Carrington?&#8221; Croyden
asked. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t see her face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t see it!&#8221; said Macloud. &#8220;I noticed
a bag in the trap, however, so I reckon she&#8217;s a
guest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunate for you!&#8221; Croyden sympathized.
&#8220;Your opportunity, for the solitariness of two,
will be limited.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll look to you for help!&#8221; Macloud answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! You may look in vain. It depends
on what she is&mdash;I&#8217;m not sacrificing myself on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
altar of general unattractiveness.&#8221; Then he
laughed. &#8220;Rest easy, I&#8217;ll fuss her to the limit.
You shan&#8217;t have her to plead for an excuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An excuse for what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For not winning the Symphony in Blue.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re overly solicitous. I&#8217;m not worried
about the guest,&#8221; Macloud remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a certain style about as much of
her as I could see which promised very well,&#8221; Croyden
remarked. &#8220;I think this would be a good day
to drop in for tea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if you find her something over sixty,
you&#8217;ll gallantly shove her off on me, and preëmpt
Miss Carrington. Oh! you&#8217;re very kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not over sixty&mdash;and you know it.
You&#8217;re by no means as blind as you would have
me believe. In fact, now that I think of it, there
was something about her that seems familiar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re an adept in many things,&#8221; laughed
Macloud, &#8220;but, I reckon, you&#8217;re not up to recognizing
a brown coat and a brown hat. I think
I&#8217;ve seen the combination once or twice before on
a woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what about tea-time&mdash;shall we go over?&#8221;
demanded Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the slightest objection&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;&mdash;to your going along with me&mdash;I&#8217;m expected!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! you&#8217;re expected, are you! pretty soon it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
will be: &#8216;Come over and see us, won&#8217;t you?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I trust so,&#8221; said Macloud, placidly.&mdash;&#8220;But,
as you&#8217;re never coming back to Northumberland,
it&#8217;s a bit impossible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! damn Northumberland!&#8221; said Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a faint recollection of having heard that
remark before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare say, it&#8217;s popular there on smoky days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which is the same as saying it&#8217;s popular there
any time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t mean that; Northumberland isn&#8217;t
half so bad as it&#8217;s painted. We may make fun of
it&mdash;but we like it, just the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose we do,&#8221; said Macloud.
&#8220;Though we get mighty sick of seeing every scatterbrain
who sets fire to the Great White Way
branded by the newspapers as a Northumberland
millionaire. We&#8217;ve got our share of fools, but we
haven&#8217;t a monopoly of them, by any means.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a marvelously large crop, however,
running loose at one time, recently!&#8221; laughed
Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;True!&mdash;and there&#8217;s the reason for it, as well as
the fallacy. Because half a hundred light-weights
were made millionaires over night, and, top heavy,
straightway went the devil&#8217;s pace, doesn&#8217;t imply
that the entire town is mad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all!&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;It&#8217;s no worse
than any other big town&mdash;and the fellows with
unsavory reputations aren&#8217;t representative. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
just came all in a bunch. The misfortune is, that
the whole country saw the fireworks, and it hasn&#8217;t
forgot the lurid display.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And isn&#8217;t likely to very soon,&#8221; Macloud responded,
&#8220;with the whole Municipal Government
rotten to the core, councilmen falling over one
another in their eagerness to plead <i>nolle contendere</i>
and escape the penitentiary, bankers in jail for
bribery, or fighting extradition; and graft! graft!
graft! permeating every department of the civic
life&mdash;and published by the newspapers&#8217; broadcast,
through the land, for all the world to read, while
the people, as a body, sit supine, and meekly suffer
the robbers to remain. The trouble with the
Northumberlander is, that so long as he is not the
immediate victim of a hold up, he is quiescent. Let
him be touched direct&mdash;by burglary, by theft, by
embezzlement&mdash;and the yell he lets out wakes the
entire bailiwick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the same everywhere,&#8221; said Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not,&mdash;other communities have waked
up&mdash;Northumberland hasn&#8217;t. There is too much
of the moneyed interest to be looked after; and
the councilmen know it, and are out for the stuff,
as brazen as the street-walker, and vastly more
insistent.&mdash;I&#8217;m going in here, for some cigarettes&mdash;when
I come out, we&#8217;ll change the talk to something
less irritating. I like Northumberland, but
I despise about ninety-nine one hundredths of its
inhabitants.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></p>
<p>When he returned, Croyden was gazing after
an automobile which was disappearing in a cloud
of dust.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever see a motor before?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>Croyden did not hear him. &#8220;The fellow driving,
unless I am mightily fooled, is the same who
stopped me on the street, in front of Clarendon,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s interesting&mdash;any one with him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A woman! You&#8217;re safe!&#8221; said Macloud. &#8220;He
isn&#8217;t travelling around with a petticoat&mdash;at least,
if he&#8217;s thinking of tackling you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t likely, I admit&mdash;but suppose he is?&#8221;</p>
<p>The car was rapidly vanishing in the distance.
Macloud nodded toward it.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is leaving here as fast as the wheels will
turn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a very accurate memory for faces,&#8221;
said Croyden. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t well be mistaken.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait and see. If it was he, and he has some
new scheme, it will be declared in due time. Nothing
yet from the Government?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bluff! So long as they think you have
the jewels, they will try for them. There&#8217;s Captain
Carrington standing at his office door. Suppose
we go over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sitting up to grandfather-in-law!&#8221; laughed
Croyden. &#8220;Distinctly proper, sir, distinctly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
proper! Go and chat with him; I&#8217;ll stop for you,
presently.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Meanwhile, the two women had continued on to
Ashburton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he recognize me?&#8221; Elaine asked, dropping
her muff from before her face, when they were
past the two men.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; answered Davila.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he give any indication of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None, whatever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would make a difference in my&mdash;attitude
toward him when we met!&#8221; she smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Naturally! a very great difference.&#8221; Elaine
was nervous, she saw. The fact that Croyden
did not come out and stop them, that he let them
go on, was sufficient proof that he had not recognized
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, I am assuming that you know why I
wanted to come to Hampton,&#8221; Elaine said, when,
her greeting made to Mrs. Carrington, she had
carried Davila along to her room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear,&#8221; Davila responded.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you made it very easy for me to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did as I thought you would want&mdash;and as
I know you would do with me were I in a similar
position.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sadly afraid I should not have thought
of you, were you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, you would! If you had been in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
small town, and Mr. Croyden had told you of my
difficulty&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As <i>Mr. Macloud</i> told you of mine&mdash;I see, dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly that,&#8221; said Davila, blushing.
&#8220;Mr. Macloud has been very attentive and very nice
and all that, you know, but you mustn&#8217;t forget
there are not many girls here, and I&#8217;m convenient,
and&mdash;I don&#8217;t take him seriously.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How does he take you?&#8221; Elaine asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;sometimes I think he does, and
sometimes I think he doesn&#8217;t!&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;He
is an accomplished flirt and difficult to gauge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, let me tell you one fact, for your information:
there isn&#8217;t a more indifferent man in
Northumberland. He goes everywhere, is in great
demand, is enormously popular, yet, I&#8217;ve never
known him to have even an affair. He is armor-plated&mdash;but
he is a dear, a perfect dear, Davila!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it!&#8221; she said, with heightening color&mdash;and
Elaine said no more, then.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall you prefer to meet Mr. Croyden alone,
for the first time, or in company?&#8221; Davila asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I confess I don&#8217;t know, but I think, however,
it would be better to have a few words with Colin,
first&mdash;if it can be arranged.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Carrington nodded. &#8220;Mr. Macloud is to
come in a moment before luncheon, if he can find
an excuse that will not include Mr. Croyden.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is an excuse difficult to find&mdash;or is any, even,
needed?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></p>
<p>Elaine smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t usually come before four&mdash;that&#8217;s
the tea hour in Hampton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tea!&#8221; exclaimed Elaine. &#8220;If you&#8217;ve got him
into the tea habit, you can do what you want
with him&mdash;he will eat out of your hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never tried him with tea,&#8221; said Davila. &#8220;He
chose a high ball the first time&mdash;so it&#8217;s been a
high ball ever since.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With gratifying regularity?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I admit it!&#8221; laughed Davila.</p>
<p>Elaine sat down on the couch and put her arm
about Davila.</p>
<p>&#8220;These awful men!&#8221; she said. &#8220;But we shall
be good friends, better friends than ever, Davila,
when you come to Northumberland to live.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is just the question, Elaine,&#8221; was the
quick answer; &#8220;whether I shall be given the opportunity,
and whether I shall take it, if I am.
I haven&#8217;t let it go so far, because I don&#8217;t feel
sure of him. Until I do, I intend to keep tight
hold on myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do it&mdash;if you can. You&#8217;ll find it much the
happier way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just before luncheon, Macloud arrived.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bully for you!&#8221; was his greeting to Miss
Cavendish. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see you here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m here, thanks to you,&#8221; said Elaine&mdash;and
Davila not being present, she kissed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m more than repaid!&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But you wish it were&mdash;another?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;but I wish the other&mdash;would, too!&#8221; he
laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give her the chance, Colin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think I may dare?&#8221; eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not wont to be so timid,&#8221; she returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I had some of your bravery,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it bravery?&#8221; she demanded. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it
impetuous womanliness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit! There isn&#8217;t a doubt as to his
feelings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But there is a doubt as to his letting them
control&mdash;I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! And you alone can help him solve it&mdash;if
any one can. And I have great hopes, Elaine,
great hopes!&#8221; regarding her with approving eyes.
&#8220;How any chap could resist you is inconceivable&mdash;I
could not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You could not at one time, you mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You gave me no encouragement,&mdash;so I must,
perforce, fare elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And now?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many love affairs have you come down
here to settle?&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;By the way, Croyden
is impatient to come over this afternoon. The
guest in the trap with Miss Carrington has aroused
his curiosity. He could see only a long brown
coat and a brown hat, but the muff before your
face, and his imagination, did the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does he suspect?&#8221; she inquired, anxiously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That it&#8217;s you? No! no! It&#8217;s simply the
country town beginning to tell on him. He is
curious about new guests, and Miss Carrington
hadn&#8217;t mentioned your coming! He suggested, in
a vague sort of way, that there was something
familiar about you, but he didn&#8217;t attempt to particularize.
It was only a momentary idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked her relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall you meet him alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not&mdash;we shall all be present.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And <i>how</i> shall you meet him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It depends on how he meets me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you don&#8217;t know much about it&mdash;haven&#8217;t
any plans?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t. Everything depends on the
moment. He will know why I&#8217;m here, and whether
he is glad or sorry or displeased at my coming, I
shall know instantly. I shall then have my cue.
It&#8217;s absurd, this notion of his, and why let
it rule him and me! I&#8217;ve always got what I
wanted, and I&#8217;m going to get Geoffrey. A
Queen of a Nation must propose to a suitor, so
why not a Queen of Money to a man less rich
than she&mdash;especially when she is convinced that that
alone keeps them apart. I shall give him a chance
to propose to me first; several chances, indeed!&#8221;
she laughed. &#8220;Then, if he doesn&#8217;t respond&mdash;I
shall do it myself.&#8221;</p>

<h2>XVII</h2>
<h3>A HANDKERCHIEF AND A GLOVE</h3>
</div>

<p>Miss Cavendish was standing behind the curtains
in the window of her room, when Croyden
and Macloud came up the walk, at four o&#8217;clock.</p>
<p>She was waiting!&mdash;not another touch to be given
to her attire. Her gown, of shimmering blue
silk, clung to her figure with every movement, and
fell to the floor in suggestively revealing folds.
Her dark hair was arranged in simple fashion&mdash;the
simplicity of exquisite taste&mdash;making the fair face
below it, seem fairer even than it was. She was
going to win this man.</p>
<p>She heard them enter the lower hall, and pass
into the drawing-room. She glided out to the
stairway, and stood, peering down over the balustrade.
She heard Miss Carrington&#8217;s greeting and
theirs&mdash;heard Macloud&#8217;s chuckle, and Croyden&#8217;s
quiet laugh. Then she heard Macloud say:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Croyden is anxious to meet your guest&mdash;at
least, we took her to be a guest you were driving
with this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My guest is equally anxious to meet Mr.
Croyden,&#8221; Miss Carrington replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why does she tarry, then?&#8221; laughed Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever know a woman to be ready?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am the hostess!&#8221; she explained.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Croyden imagined there was something
familiar about her,&#8221; Macloud remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean you recognized her?&#8221; Miss Carrington
asked.</p>
<p>(Elaine strained her ears to catch his answer.)</p>
<p>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t let me have the chance to recognize
her,&#8221; said he&mdash;&#8220;she wouldn&#8217;t let me see her face.&#8221;</p>
<p>(Elaine gave a little sigh of relief.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t?&#8221; Miss Carrington interrogated.</p>
<p>&#8220;At least, she didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She couldn&#8217;t have covered it completely&mdash;she
saw you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t raise his hopes too high!&#8221; Macloud
interjected.</p>
<p>&#8220;She can&#8217;t&mdash;I&#8217;m on the pinnacle of expectation,
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humpty-Dumpty risks a great fall!&#8221; Macloud
warned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all!&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;If the guest
doesn&#8217;t please me, I&#8217;m going to talk to Miss Carrington.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re growing blasé,&#8221; she warned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that an evidence of it?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;If
it is, I know one who must be too blasé even to
move,&#8221; with a meaning glance at Macloud.</p>
<p>A light foot-fall on the stairs, the soft swish of
skirts in the hallway, Croyden turned, expectantly&mdash;and
Miss Cavendish entered the room.</p>
<p>There was an instant&#8217;s silence. Croyden&#8217;s from
astonishment; the others&#8217; with watching him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></p>
<p>Elaine&#8217;s eyes were intent on Croyden&#8217;s face&mdash;and
what she saw there gave her great content:
he might not be persuaded, but he loved her, and
he would not misunderstand. Her face brightened
with a fascinating smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are surprised to see me, messieurs?&#8221; she
asked, curtsying low.</p>
<p>Croyden&#8217;s eyes turned quickly to his friend, and
back again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure as to Monsieur Macloud,&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But for yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surprised is quite too light a word&mdash;stunned
would but meekly express it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did neither of you ever hear me mention Miss
Carrington?&mdash;We were friends, almost chums, at
Dobbs Ferry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I did, it has escaped me?&#8221; Croyden smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re likely not to forget it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you know that I&mdash;that we were here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly! I knew that you and Colin were
both here,&#8221; Elaine replied, imperturbably. &#8220;Do
you think yourself so unimportant as not to be
mentioned by Miss Carrington?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What will you have to drink, Mr. Croyden?&#8221;
Davila inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;A sour ball, by all means.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that a reflection on my guest?&#8221; she asked&mdash;while
Elaine and Macloud laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;A reflection on your guest?&#8221; he inflected,
puzzled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You said you would take a <i>sour</i> ball.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden held up his hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fussed!&#8221; he confessed. &#8220;I have nothing
to plead. A man who mixes a high ball with a
sour ball is either rattled or drunk, I am not the
latter, therefore&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean that my coming has rattled you?&#8221;
Elaine inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;I&#8217;m rattled for very joy.&#8221;</p>
<p>She put her hands before her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spare my blushes, Geoffrey!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You could spare a few&mdash;and not miss them!&#8221;
he laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Davila, am I?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blushing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not the slightest, dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s your sour ball!&#8221; said Macloud, handing
him the glass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sweetened by your touch, I suppose!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No! By the ladies&#8217; presence&mdash;God save them!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Colin,&#8221; said Croyden, as, an hour later, they
walked back to Clarendon, &#8220;you should have told
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Should have told you what?&#8221; Macloud asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t affect ignorance, old man&mdash;you knew
Elaine was coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did&mdash;yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that it was she in the trap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The muff hid her face from me, too.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But you knew.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could only guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think it was wise to let her come?&#8221;
Croyden demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had nothing to do with her decision. Miss
Carrington asked her, she accepted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you give her my address?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I most assuredly did not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden looked at him, doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m telling you the truth,&#8221; said Macloud.
&#8220;She tried to get your address, when I was last
in Northumberland, and I refused.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then, she stumbles on it through Davila
Carrington! The world <i>is</i> small. I reckon, if I
went off into some deserted spot in Africa, it
wouldn&#8217;t be a month until some fellow I knew, or
who knows a mutual friend, would come nosing
around, and blow on me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sorry she came?&#8221; Macloud asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No! I&#8217;m not sorry she came&mdash;at least, not
now, since she&#8217;s here.&mdash;I&#8217;ll be sorry enough when
she goes, however.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you will let her go?&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden nodded. &#8220;I must&mdash;it&#8217;s the only proper
thing to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Proper for whom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For both!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would it not be better that <i>she</i> should decide
what is proper for her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Proper for me, then.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Based on your peculiar notion of relative
wealth between husband and wife&mdash;without regard
to what she may think on the subject. In other
words, have you any right to decline the risk, if
she is willing to undertake it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The risk is mine, not hers. She has the money.
Her income, for three months, about equals my
entire fortune.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you forget her fortune?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And live at the rate of pretty near two
hundred thousand dollars a year?&#8221; Croyden
laughed. &#8220;Could you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I could, if I loved the girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And suffer in your self-respect forever after?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is where we differ. You&#8217;re inclined to
be hyper-critical. If you play <i>your</i> part, you
won&#8217;t lose your self-respect.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a trifle difficult to do&mdash;to play my part,
when all the world is saying, &#8216;he married her for
her money,&#8217; and shows me scant regard in consequence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why the devil need you care what the world
says!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; Macloud exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t&mdash;the world may go hang. But the
question is, how long can the man retain the woman&#8217;s
esteem, with such a handicap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! that is easy! so long as he retains her
love.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Rather an uncertain quantity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It depends entirely on yourself.&mdash;If you start
with it, you can hold it, if you take the trouble
to try.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a strong partisan!&#8221; Croyden laughed,
as they entered Clarendon.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what are you?&#8221; Macloud returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what I should like to know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell you what you are if you don&#8217;t
marry Elaine Cavendish,&#8221; Macloud interrupted&mdash;&#8220;You&#8217;re
an unmitigated fool!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Assuming that Miss Cavendish would marry
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not likely to marry her, otherwise,&#8221;
retorted Macloud, as he went up the stairs. On
the landing he halted and looked down at Croyden in
the hall below. &#8220;And if you don&#8217;t take your chance,
the chance she has deliberately offered you by coming
to Hampton, you are worse than&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and, with
an expressive gesture, he resumed the ascent.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know she came down here just
for that purpose?&#8221; Croyden called.</p>
<p>But all that came back in answer, as Macloud
went down the hall and into his room, was the
whistled air from a popular opera, then running
in the Metropolis.</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '><tr><td>

</td></tr></table>

<p>The door slammed&mdash;the music ceased.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t believe it,&#8221; Croyden reflected, &#8220;that
Elaine would do anything so utterly unconventional
as to seek me out deliberately.... I might have
had a chance if&mdash;Oh, damn it all! why didn&#8217;t we
find the old pirate&#8217;s box&mdash;it would have clarified
the whole situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he changed into his evening clothes, he went
over the matter, carefully, and laid out the line
of conduct that he intended to follow.</p>
<p>He would that Elaine had stayed away from
Hampton. It was putting him to too severe a
test&mdash;to be with her, to be subject to her alluring
loveliness, and, yet, to be unmoved. It is hard to
see the luscious fruit within one&#8217;s reach and to
refrain from even touching it. It grew harder
the more he contemplated it....</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use fighting against it, here!&#8221; he exclaimed,
going into Macloud&#8217;s room, and throwing
himself on a chair. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to cut the whole
thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What the devil are you talking about?&#8221; Macloud
inquired, pausing with his waistcoat half on.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the devil do you think I&#8217;m talking
about?&#8221; Croyden demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not being a success at solving riddles, I give
it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, very well!&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;Can you
comprehend this:&mdash;I&#8217;m going to leave town?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly&mdash;that&#8217;s plain English. When are
you going?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why this suddenness?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To get away quickly&mdash;to escape.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From Elaine?&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden nodded.</p>
<p>Macloud smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is coming to it, at last,&#8221; he thought.
What he said was:&mdash;&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to be put
to flight by a woman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am.&mdash;If I stay here I shall lose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall propose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And be refused?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be accepted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most people would not call that <i>losing</i>,&#8221; said
Macloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have nothing to do with most people&mdash;only,
with myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems so!&mdash;even Elaine isn&#8217;t to be considered.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t we gone over all that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;but, if we have, go over it
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You assume she came down here solely on my
account&mdash;because I&#8217;m here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I assume nothing,&#8221; Macloud answered, with a
quiet chuckle. &#8220;I said you have a chance, and
urged you not to let it slip. I should not have
offered any suggestion&mdash;I admit that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, bosh!&#8221; Croyden interrupted. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
so humble&mdash;you&#8217;re rather proud of your interference.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am! Certainly, I am! I&#8217;m only sorry it is
so unavailing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who said it was unavailing!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did!&mdash;or, at least, I inferred as much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not responsible for your inferences.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you responsible for?&#8221; asked Macloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing! Nothing!&mdash;not even for my resolution&mdash;I
haven&#8217;t any&mdash;I can&#8217;t make any that holds.
I&#8217;m worse than a weather-cock. Common sense
bids me go. Desire clamors for me to stay&mdash;to
hasten over to Ashburton&mdash;to put it to the test.
When I get to Ashburton, common sense will be
in control. When I come away, desire will tug
me back, again&mdash;and so on, and so on&mdash;and so
on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re in a bad way!&#8221; laughed Macloud.
&#8220;You need a cock-tail, instead of a weather-cock.
Come on! if we are to dine at the Carringtons&#8217;
at seven, we would better be moving. Having
thrown the blue funk, usual to a man in your
position, you&#8217;ll now settle down to business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be or not to be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let future events determine&mdash;take it as it
comes,&#8221; Macloud urged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sage advice!&#8221; returned Croyden mockingly.
&#8220;If I let future events decide for me, the end&#8217;s
already fixed.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></p>
<p>The big clock on the landing was chiming seven
when they rang the bell at Ashburton and the maid
ushered them into the drawing-room. Mrs. Carrington
was out of town, visiting in an adjoining
county, and the Captain had not appeared. He
came down stairs a moment later, and took Macloud
and Croyden over to the library.</p>
<p>After about a quarter of an hour, he glanced
at his watch a trifle impatiently.&mdash;Another fifteen
minutes, and he glanced at it again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Caroline!&#8221; he called, as the maid passed the
door. &#8220;Go up to Miss Davila&#8217;s room and tell
her it&#8217;s half-after-seven.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he continued with the story he was relating.</p>
<p>Presently, the maid returned; the Captain
looked at her, interrogatingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mis&#8217; Davila, she ain&#8217; deah, no seh,&#8221; said the
girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is probably in Miss Cavendish&#8217;s room,&mdash;look,
there, for her,&#8221; the Captain directed.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, seh! I looks dyar&mdash;she ain&#8217; no place up
stairs, and neither is Mis&#8217; Cav&#8217;dish, seh. Hit&#8217;s all
dark, in dey rooms, seh, all dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very singular,&#8221; said the Captain. &#8220;Half-after-seven,
and not here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They were here, two hours ago,&#8221; said Croyden.
&#8220;We had tea with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Find out from the other servants whether they
left any word.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Dey didn&#8217;, seh! no, seh! I ax&#8217;d dem, seh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very singular, indeed! excuse me, sirs, I&#8217;ll try
to locate them.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went to the telephone, and called up the
Lashiels, the Tilghmans, the Tayloes, and all their
neighbors and intimates, only to receive the same
answer: &#8220;They were not there, and hadn&#8217;t been
there that afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is amazing, sirs!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I will
go up myself and see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are at your service, Captain Carrington,&#8221;
said Macloud instantly.&mdash;&#8220;At your service for anything
we can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They knew, of course, you were expected for
dinner?&#8221; he asked, as he led the way upstairs.&mdash;&#8220;I
can&#8217;t account for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Captain inspected his granddaughter&#8217;s and
Miss Cavendish&#8217;s rooms, Macloud and Croyden,
being discreet, the rooms on the other side of the
house. They discovered nothing which would explain.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will have dinner,&#8221; said the Captain.
&#8220;They will surely turn up before we have finished.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dinner ended, however, and the missing ones
had not returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Might they have gone for a drive?&#8221; Macloud
suggested.</p>
<p>The Captain shook his head. &#8220;The keys of
the stable are on my desk, which shows that the
horses are in for the night. I admit I am at a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
loss&mdash;however, I reckon they will be in presently,
with an explanation and a good laugh at us for
being anxious.&#8221;</p>
<p>But when nine o&#8217;clock came, and then half-after-nine,
and still they did not appear, the men grew
seriously alarmed.</p>
<p>The Captain had recourse to the telephone
again, getting residence after residence, without
result. At last he hung up the receiver.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to make of it,&#8221; he said,
bewildered. &#8220;I&#8217;ve called every place I can think
of, and I can&#8217;t locate them. What can have
happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us see how the matter stands,&#8221; said Macloud.
&#8220;We left them here about half-after-five,
and, so far as can be ascertained, no one has seen
them since. Consequently, they must have gone
out for a walk or a drive. A drive is most unlikely,
at this time of the day&mdash;it is dark and
cold. Furthermore, your horses are in the stable,
so, if they went, they didn&#8217;t go alone&mdash;some one
drove them. The alternative&mdash;a walk&mdash;is the
probable explanation; and that remits us to an
accident as the cause of delay. Which, it seems
to me, is the likely explanation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if there were an accident, they would
have been discovered, long since; the walks are
not deserted,&#8221; the Captain objected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly, they went out of the town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A young woman never goes out of town, unescorted,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
was the decisive answer. &#8220;This is a
Southern town, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you don&#8217;t care to telephone the
police?&#8221; asked Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;not yet,&#8221; the Captain replied. &#8220;Davila
would never forgive me, if nothing really were
wrong&mdash;besides, I couldn&#8217;t. The Mayor&#8217;s office
is closed for the night&mdash;we&#8217;re not supposed to need
the police after six o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Croyden and I will patrol the roads,
hereabout,&#8221; said Macloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! I will go out the Queen Street pike a
mile or two,&#8221; the Captain said. &#8220;You and Mr.
Croyden can take the King Street pike, North and
South. We&#8217;ll meet here not later than eleven
o&#8217;clock. Excuse me a moment&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you make of it?&#8221; said Macloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is either very serious or else it&#8217;s nothing
at all. I mean, if anything <i>has</i> happened, it&#8217;s far
out of the ordinary,&#8221; Croyden answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly my idea&mdash;though, I confess, I haven&#8217;t
a notion what the serious side could be. It&#8217;s safe
to assume that they didn&#8217;t go into the country&mdash;the
hour, alone, would have deterred them, even
if the danger from the negro were not present,
constantly, in Miss Carrington&#8217;s mind. On the
other hand, how could anything have happened in
the town which would prevent one of them from
telephoning, or sending a message, or getting some
sort of word to the Captain.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all very mysterious&mdash;yet, I dare say, easy
of solution and explanation. There isn&#8217;t any danger
of the one thing that is really terrifying, so I&#8217;m
not inclined to be alarmed, unduly&mdash;just disquieted.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this moment Captain Carrington returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here! take these,&#8221; he said, giving each a
revolver. &#8220;Let us hope there won&#8217;t be any occasion
to use them, but it is well to be prepared.&#8221;</p>
<p>They went out together&mdash;at the intersection of
Queen and King Streets, they parted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember! eleven o&#8217;clock at my house,&#8221; said
the Captain. &#8220;If any one of us isn&#8217;t there, the
other two will know he needs assistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden went north on King Street. It was a
chilly November night, with frost in the air. The
moon, in its second quarter and about to sink into
the waters of the Bay, gave light sufficient to
make walking easy, where the useless street lamps
did not kill it with their timid brilliancy. He
passed the limits of the town, and struck out into
the country. It had just struck ten, when they
parted&mdash;he would walk for half an hour, and then
return. He could do three miles&mdash;a mile and a
half each way&mdash;and still be at the Carrington
house by eleven. He proceeded along the east side
of the road, his eyes busy lest, in the uncertain
light, he miss anything which might serve as a
clue. For the allotted time, he searched but found
nothing&mdash;he must return. He crossed to the west
side of the road, and faced homeward.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></p>
<p>A mile passed&mdash;a quarter more was added&mdash;the
feeble lights of the town were gleaming dimly in
the fore, when, beside the track, he noticed a small
white object.</p>
<p>It was a woman&#8217;s handkerchief, and, as he picked
it up, a faint odor of violets was clinging to it
still. Here might be a clue&mdash;there was a monogram
on the corner, but he could not distinguish
it, in the darkness. He put it in his pocket and
hastened on. A hundred feet farther, and his
foot hit something soft. He groped about, with
his hands, and found&mdash;a woman&#8217;s glove. It, also,
bore the odor of violets.</p>
<p>At the first lamp-post, he stopped and examined
the handkerchief&mdash;the monogram was plain: E. C.&mdash;and
violets, he remembered, were her favorite perfume.
He took out the glove&mdash;a soft, undressed kid
affair&mdash;but there was no mark on it to help him.
He glanced at his watch. His time had almost
expired. He pushed the feminine trifles back into
his pocket, and hurried on.</p>
<p>He was late, and when he arrived at Ashburton,
Captain Carrington and Macloud were just about
to start in pursuit.</p>
<p>&#8220;I found these!&#8221; he said, tossing the glove
and the handkerchief on the table&mdash;&#8220;on the
west side of the road, about half a mile from
town.&#8221;</p>
<p>Macloud picked them up.</p>
<p>&#8220;The violets are familiar&mdash;and the handkerchief
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
is Elaine&#8217;s,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I recognize the monogram
as hers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you make of it?&#8221; Captain Carrington
demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing&mdash;it passes me.&#8221;</p>
<p>His glance sought Croyden&#8217;s.</p>
<p>A shake of the head was his answer.</p>
<p>The Captain strode to the telephone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to call in our friends,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I think we shall need them.&#8221;</p>

<h3>THE LONE HOUSE BY THE BAY</h3>
</div>

<p>When Croyden and Macloud left the Carrington
residence that evening, after their call and tea,
Elaine and Davila remained for a little while
in the drawing-room rehearsing the events of
the day, as women will. Presently, Davila went
over to draw the shades.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you say to a walk before we dress
for dinner?&#8221; she inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like it, immensely,&#8221; Elaine answered.</p>
<p>They went upstairs, changed quickly to street
attire, and set out.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will go down to the centre of the town and
back,&#8221; said Davila. &#8220;It&#8217;s about half a mile each
way, and there isn&#8217;t any danger, so long as you
keep in the town. I shouldn&#8217;t venture beyond it
unescorted, however, even in daylight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Elaine. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t Hampton
orderly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hampton is orderly enough. It&#8217;s the curse
that hangs over the South since the Civil War:
the negro.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! I understand,&#8221; said Elaine, shuddering.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean that all black men are bad, for
they are not. Many are entirely trustworthy, but
the trustworthy ones are much, very much, in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
minority. The vast majority are worthless&mdash;and
a worthless nigger is the worst thing on earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I prefer only the lighted streets,&#8221;
Elaine remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you will be perfectly safe there,&#8221; Davila
replied.</p>
<p>They swung briskly along to the centre of the
town&mdash;where the two main thoroughfares, King
and Queen Streets, met each other in a wide circle
that, after the fashion of Southern towns, was
known, incongruously enough, as &#8220;The Diamond.&#8221;
Passing around this circle, they retraced their steps
toward home.</p>
<p>As they neared Ashburton, an automobile with
the top up and side curtains on shot up behind
them, hesitated a moment, as though uncertain of
its destination and then drew up before the Carrington
place. Two men alighted, gave an order
to the driver, and went across the pavement to
the gate, while the engine throbbed, softly.</p>
<p>Then they seemed to notice the women approaching,
and stepping back from the gate, they waited.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon!&#8221; said one, raising his
hat and bowing, &#8220;can you tell me if this is where
Captain Carrington lives?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; answered Davila.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you!&#8221; said the man, standing aside
to let them pass.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Miss Carrington&mdash;whom do you wish to
see?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Carrington, is he at home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know&mdash;if you will come in, I&#8217;ll inquire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re very kind!&#8221; with another bow.</p>
<p>He sprang forward and opened the gate. Davila
thanked him with a smile, and she and Elaine went
in, leaving the strangers to follow.</p>
<p>The next instant, each girl was struggling in
the folds of a shawl, which had been flung over
her from behind and wrapped securely around her
head and arms, smothering her cries to a mere
whisper. In a trice, despite their struggles&mdash;which,
with heads covered and arms held close to their
sides, were utterly unavailing&mdash;they were caught
up, tossed into the tonneau, and the car shot
swiftly away.</p>
<p>In a moment, it was clear of the town, the
driver &#8220;opened her up,&#8221; and they sped through
the country at thirty miles an hour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better give them some air,&#8221; said the leader.
&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter how much they yell here.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had been holding Elaine on his lap, his arms
keeping the shawl tight around her. Now he
loosed her, and unwound the folds.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will please pardon the liberty we have
taken,&#8221; he said, as he freed her, &#8220;but there
are&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>Elaine had struck him straight in the face with
all her strength, and, springing free, was on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
point of leaping out, when he seized her and forced
her back, caught her arms in the shawl, which was
still around her, and bound them tight to her side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better be a little careful, Bill!&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
got an upper cut on the jaw that made me see
stars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been very easy with mine,&#8221; his companion
returned. &#8220;She&#8217;ll not hand me one.&#8221; However,
he took care not to loosen the shawl from her
arms. &#8220;There you are, my lady, I hope you&#8217;ve not
been greatly inconvenienced.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by this outrage?&#8221; said
Davila.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget, Bill!&mdash;mum&#8217;s the word!&#8221; the
chief cautioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;At least, you can permit us to sit on the
floor of the car,&#8221; said Elaine. &#8220;Whatever may
be your scheme, it&#8217;s scarcely necessary to hold us
in this disgusting position.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you make no effort to escape?&#8221; the chief
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon that is a trifle overstated!&#8221; he
laughed. &#8220;What about you, Miss Carrington?&#8221;</p>
<p>Davila did not answer&mdash;contenting herself with
a look, which was far more expressive than words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we will take pleasure in honoring your
first request, Miss Cavendish.&#8221;</p>
<p>He caught up a piece of rope, passed it around
her arms, outside the shawl, tied it in a running
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
knot, and quietly lifted her from his lap to the
floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I trust that is satisfactory?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;By comparison, eminently so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Do you, Miss Carrington,
wish to sit beside your friend?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you please!&#8221; said Davila, with supreme
contempt.</p>
<p>He took the rope and tied her, likewise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good, Bill!&#8221; he said, and they placed her
beside Elaine.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will permit your legs to be tied, we will
gladly let you have the seat&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t think you would&mdash;so you will
have to remain on the floor; you see, you might
be tempted to jump, if we gave you the seat.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were running so rapidly, through the night
air, that the country could scarcely be distinguished,
as it rushed by them. To Elaine, it was an unknown
land. Davila, however, was looking for
something she could recognize&mdash;some building that
she knew, some stream, some topographical formation.
But in the faint and uncertain moonlight,
coupled with the speed at which they travelled, she
was baffled. The chief observed, however.</p>
<p>&#8220;With your permission!&#8221; he said, and taking
two handkerchiefs from his pocket, he bound the
eyes of both.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is only for a short while,&#8221; he explained&mdash;&#8220;matter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
of an hour or so, and you suffer no
particular inconvenience, I trust.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neither Elaine nor Davila condescended to reply.</p>
<p>After a moment&#8217;s pause, the man went on:</p>
<p>&#8220;I neglected to say&mdash;and I apologize for my
remissness&mdash;that you need fear no ill-treatment.
You will be shown every consideration&mdash;barring
freedom, of course&mdash;and all your wants, within the
facilities at our command, will be gratified. Naturally,
however, you will not be permitted to communicate
with your friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How nice of you!&#8221; said Elaine. &#8220;But I
should be better pleased if you would tell us the
reason for this abduction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That, I regret, I am not at liberty to discuss.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long are we to remain prisoners?&#8221; demanded
Davila.</p>
<p>&#8220;It depends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Upon what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Upon whether something is acceded to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By whom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not at liberty to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if it is not acceded to?&#8221; Elaine inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;In that event&mdash;it would be necessary to decide
what should be done with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Done with us! What do you mean to imply?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing!&mdash;the time hasn&#8217;t come to imply&mdash;I
hope it will not come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; said Davila.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Because is no reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a woman&#8217;s reason!&#8221; said he, laughing
lightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean that your failure would imperil
our lives?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Something like it?&#8221; he replied, after a moment&#8217;s
thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our lives!&#8221; Davila cried. &#8220;Do you appreciate
what you are saying!&#8221;</p>
<p>The man did not answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it possible you mean to threaten our lives?&#8221;
Davila persisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I threaten nothing&mdash;yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you threaten nothing, yet!&#8221; she mocked.
&#8220;But you will threaten, if&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly! if&mdash;you are at liberty to guess the
rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care to guess!&#8221; she retorted. &#8220;Do
you appreciate that the whole Eastern Shore will
be searching for us by morning&mdash;and that, if the
least indignity is offered us, your lives won&#8217;t be
worth a penny?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We take the risk, Miss Carrington,&#8221; replied
the man, placidly.</p>
<p>Davila shrugged her shoulders, and they rode
in silence, for half an hour.</p>
<p>Then the speed of the car slackened, they ran
slowly for half a mile, and stopped. The chief
reached down, untied the handkerchiefs, and sprang
out.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You may descend,&#8221; he said, offering his hand.</p>
<p>Elaine saw the hand, and ignored it; Davila
refused even to see the hand.</p>
<p>They could make out, in the dim light, that they
were before a long, low, frame building, with the
waters of the Bay just beyond. A light burned
within, and, as they entered, the odor of cooking
greeted them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank goodness! they don&#8217;t intend to starve
us!&#8221; said Elaine. &#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s scarcely proper
in an abducted maiden, but I&#8217;m positively famished.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m too enraged to eat,&#8221; said Davila.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you afraid?&#8221; Elaine asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid?&mdash;not in the least!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No more am I&mdash;but oughtn&#8217;t we be afraid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know! I&#8217;m too angry to know anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had been halted on the porch, while the
chief went in, presumably, to see that all was ready
for their reception. Now, he returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will come in,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I will show
you to your apartment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Prison, you mean,&#8221; said Davila.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apartment is a little better word, don&#8217;t you
think?&#8221; said he. &#8220;However, as you wish, Miss
Carrington, as you wish! We shall try to make
you comfortable, whatever you may call your temporary
quarters.&mdash;These two rooms are yours,&#8221; he
continued, throwing open the door. &#8220;They are
small, but quiet and retired; you will not, I am
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
sure, be disturbed. Pardon me, if I remove these
ropes, you will be less hampered in your movements.
There! supper will be served in fifteen
minutes&mdash;you will be ready?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we shall be ready,&#8221; said Elaine, and the
man bowed and retired. &#8220;He has some manners!&#8221;
she reflected.</p>
<p>&#8220;They might be worse,&#8221; Davila retorted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which is some satisfaction,&#8221; Elaine added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!&mdash;and we best be thankful for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The rooms aren&#8217;t so bad,&#8221; said Elaine, looking
around.</p>
<p>&#8220;We each have a bed, and a bureau, and a
wash-stand, and a couple of chairs, a few chromos,
a rug on the floor&mdash;and bars at the window.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I noticed the bars,&#8221; said Davila.</p>
<p>Elaine crossed to her wash-stand.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve provided us with water, so we may
as well use it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think my face needs&mdash;Heavens!
what a sight I am!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you observed the same sight in me?&#8221;
Davila asked. &#8220;I&#8217;ve lost all my puffs, I know&mdash;and
so have you&mdash;and your hat is a trifle awry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since we&#8217;re not trying to make an impression,
I reckon it doesn&#8217;t matter!&#8221; laughed Elaine. &#8220;We
will have ample opportunity to put them to rights
before Colin and Geoffrey see us.&#8221;</p>
<p>She took off her hat, pressed her hair into shape,
replaced a few pins, dashed water on her face, and
washed her hands.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; she said, going into the other room
where Miss Carrington was doing likewise, &#8220;if I
only had a powder-rag, I&#8217;d feel dressed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Davila turned, and, taking a little book, from
the pocket of her coat, extended it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is some Papier Poudre,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You blessed thing!&#8221; Elaine exclaimed, and,
tearing out a sheet, she rubbed it over her face. &#8220;Is
my nose shiny?&#8221; she ended.</p>
<p>A door opened and a young girl appeared, wearing
apron and cap.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ladies are served!&#8221; she announced.</p>
<p>The two looked at each other and laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is quite some style!&#8221; Davila commented.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is, indeed!&#8221; said Elaine as she saw the table,
with its candles and silver (plated, to be sure),
dainty china, and pressed glass.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the food is in keeping, I think we can get
along for a few days. We may as well enjoy it
while it lasts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Davila smiled. &#8220;You always were of a philosophic
mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the easiest way.&#8221;</p>
<p>She might have added, that it was the only way
she knew&mdash;her wealth having made all roads easy
to her.</p>
<p>The meal finished, they went back to their apartment,
to find the bed turned down for the night,
and certain lingerie, which they were without, laid
out for them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Better and better!&#8221; exclaimed Elaine. &#8220;You
might think this was a hotel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Until you tried to go out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t tried, yet&mdash;wait until morning.&#8221;
A pack of cards was on the table. &#8220;See how
thoughtful they are! Come, I&#8217;ll play you Camden
for a cent a point.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand what their move is?&#8221; said
Davila, presently. &#8220;What can they hope to accomplish
by abducting us&mdash;or me, at any rate. It
seems they don&#8217;t want anything from us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I make it, that they hope to extort something,
from a third party, through us&mdash;by holding us
prisoners.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Carrington has no money&mdash;it can&#8217;t be
he,&#8221; said Davila, &#8220;and yet, why else should they
seize me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The question is, whose hand are they trying
to force?&#8221; reflected Elaine. &#8220;They will hold us
until something is acceded to, the man said. Until
<i>what</i> is acceded to, and <i>by whom</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think that we are simply the pawns?&#8221;
asked Davila.</p>
<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if it isn&#8217;t acceded to, they will kill us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They will doubtless make the threat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pleasant prospect for us!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t contemplate it, just yet. They may
gain their point, or we may be rescued; in either
case, we&#8217;ll be saved from dying!&#8221; Elaine laughed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
&#8220;And, at the worst, I may be able to buy them
off&mdash;to pay our own ransom. If it&#8217;s money they
want, we shall not die, I assure you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You would pay what they demand?&#8221; Davila
asked, quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I have to choose between death and paying,
I reckon I&#8217;ll pay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But can you pay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I think I can pay,&#8221; she said quietly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not used to boasting my wealth, but I can
draw my check for a million, and it will be honored
without a moment&#8217;s question. Does that make you
feel easier, my dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Considerably easier,&#8221; said Davila, with a glad
laugh. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t draw my check for much more
than ten thousand cents. I am only&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She
stopped, staring.</p>
<p>&#8220;What on earth is the matter, Davila?&#8221; Elaine
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have it!&mdash;it&#8217;s the thieves!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you suddenly lost your mind?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No! I&#8217;ve found it! I&#8217;ve come out of my
trance. It&#8217;s Parmenter&#8217;s chest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Parmenter&#8217;s chest?&#8221; echoed Elaine. &#8220;I reckon
I must be in a trance, also.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hasn&#8217;t Mr. Croyden told you&mdash;or Mr. Macloud?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then maybe I shouldn&#8217;t&mdash;but I will. Parmenter&#8217;s
chest is a fortune in jewels.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A fortune in jewels, which Mr. Croyden has
searched for and not found&mdash;and the thieves
think&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You would better tell me the story,&#8221; said
Elaine, pushing back the cards.</p>
<p>And Davila told her....</p>
<p>&#8220;It is too absurd!&#8221; laughed Elaine, &#8220;those
rogues trying to force Geoffrey to divide what he
hasn&#8217;t got, and can&#8217;t find, and we abducted to constrain
him. He couldn&#8217;t comply if he wanted to,
poor fellow!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they will never believe it,&#8221; said Davila.</p>
<p>&#8220;And, meanwhile, we suffer. Well, if we&#8217;re
not rescued shortly, I can advance the price and buy
our freedom. They want half a million. Hum!
I reckon two hundred thousand will be sufficient&mdash;and,
maybe, we can compromise for one hundred
thousand. Oh! it&#8217;s not so bad, Davila, it&#8217;s not so
bad!&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled, shrewdly. Unless she were wofully
mistaken, this abduction would release her from
the embarrassment of declaring herself to Geoffrey.
She could handle the matter, now.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Davila. &#8220;Why are you
smiling so queerly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking of Colin and Geoffrey&mdash;and how
they are pretty sure to know their minds when
this affair is ended.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly! I mean, if this doesn&#8217;t bring Colin
to his senses, he is hopeless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Mr. Croyden?&#8221; Davila queried. &#8220;How
about him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will surrender, too. All his theoretical
notions of relative wealth will be forgotten. I&#8217;ve
only to wait for rescue or release. On the whole,
Davila, I&#8217;m quite satisfied with being abducted.
Moreover, it is an experience which doesn&#8217;t come
to every girl.&#8221; She looked at her friend quizzically.
&#8220;What are you going to do about Colin? I
rather think you should have an answer ready;
the circumstances are apt to make him rather
precipitate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next morning after breakfast, which was
served in their rooms, Elaine was looking out
through the bars on her window, trying to get
some notion of the country, when she saw, what she
took to be, the chief abductor approaching. He
was a tall, well-dressed man of middle age, with
the outward appearance of a gentleman. She looked
at him a moment, then rang for the maid.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to have a word with the man
who just came in,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will tell him, Miss.&#8221;</p>
<p>He appeared almost immediately, an inquiring
look on his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I serve you, Miss Cavendish?&#8221; he
said, deferentially.</p>
<p>&#8220;By permitting us to go out for some air&mdash;these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
rooms were not designed, apparently, for
permanent residence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It can be arranged,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;When do
you wish to go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At once!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good!&#8221; he said. &#8220;You will have no objection
to being attended, to make sure you don&#8217;t
stray off too far, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None whatever, if the attendant remains at a
reasonable distance.&#8221;</p>
<p>He bowed and stood aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may come,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the locality familiar?&#8221; Elaine asked, when
they were some distance from the house.</p>
<p>Davila shook her head. &#8220;It is south of Hampton,
I think, but I can&#8217;t give any reason for my
impression. The car was running very rapidly;
we were, I reckon, almost two hours on the way,
but we can&#8217;t be more than fifty miles away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they came direct&mdash;but if they circled, we
could be much less,&#8221; Elaine observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pity we didn&#8217;t think to drop something
from the car to inform our friends which way to
look for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; said Elaine. &#8220;I tossed out a handkerchief
and a glove a short distance from Hampton&mdash;just
as I struck that fellow. The difficulty
is, there isn&#8217;t any assurance we kept to that road.
Like as not, we started north and ended east or
south of town. What is this house, a fishing club?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I rather think so. There is a small wharf, and
a board-walk down to the Bay, and the house itself
is one story and spread-out, so to speak.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Likely it&#8217;s a summer club-house, which these
men have either rented or preëmpted for our prison.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The country around here is surely deserted!&#8221;
said Davila.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hence, a proper choice for our temporary residence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand the care they are taking of
us&mdash;the deference with which we are treated, the
food that is given us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Parmenter&#8217;s treasure, and the prize they think
they&#8217;re playing for, has much to do with it. We
are of considerable value, according to their idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a while, they went back to the house.
The two men, who had remained out of hearing,
but near enough to prevent any attempt to escape,
having seen them safely within, disappeared. As
they passed through the hall they encountered the
chief. He stepped aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;You enjoyed your walk, I trust?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Davila nodded curtly. Elaine stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel sorry for you!&#8221; she said, smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are very kind,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;But why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are incurring considerable expense for
nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>He grinned. &#8220;It is a very great pleasure, I
assure you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are asking the impossible,&#8221; she went on.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
&#8220;Mr. Croyden told you the simple truth. He
<i>didn&#8217;t</i> find the Parmenter jewels.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s face showed his surprise, but he only
shrugged his shoulders expressively, and made no
reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you do not believe it&mdash;yet it&#8217;s a fact,
nevertheless. Mr. Croyden couldn&#8217;t pay your demands,
if he wished. Of course, we enjoy the experience,
but, as I said, it&#8217;s a trifle expensive for
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fellow&#8217;s grin broadened.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a good sport!&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;a jolly good
sport! But we&#8217;re dealing with Mr. Croyden and
Mr. Macloud, so, you&#8217;ll pardon me if I decline to
discuss the subject.&#8221;</p>

<h2>XIX</h2>
<h3>ROBERT PARMENTER&#8217;S SUCCESSORS</h3>
</div>

<p>In half-an-hour from the time Captain Carrington
strode to the telephone to arouse his
friends, all Hampton had the startling news: Davila
Carrington and her guest, Miss Cavendish, had
disappeared.</p>
<p>How, when, and where, it could not learn, so
it supplied the deficiency as best pleased the individual&mdash;by
morning, the wildest tales were rehearsed
and credited.</p>
<p>The truth was bad enough, however. Miss Carrington
and Miss Cavendish were not in the town,
nor anywhere within a circuit of five miles. Croyden,
Macloud, all the men in the place had searched
the night through, and without avail. Every horse,
and every boat had been accounted for. It remained,
that they either had fallen into the Bay, or
had gone in a strange conveyance.</p>
<p>Croyden and Macloud had returned to Clarendon
for a bite of breakfast&mdash;very late breakfast,
at eleven o&#8217;clock. They had met by accident, on
their way to the house, having come from totally
different directions of search.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Parmenter again!&#8221; said Croyden, suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s what?&#8221; said Macloud.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Parmenter:&mdash;Pirate&#8217;s gold breeds pirate&#8217;s ways.
The lawyer villain has reappeared. I told you
it was he I saw, yesterday, driving the automobile.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite understand why they selected
Elaine and Miss Carrington to abduct,&#8221; Macloud
objected, after a moment&#8217;s consideration. &#8220;Why
didn&#8217;t they take you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because they thought we would come to time
more quickly, if they took the women. They seem
to be informed on everything, so, we can assume,
they are acquainted with your fondness for Miss
Carrington and mine for Elaine. Or, it&#8217;s possible
they thought that we both were interested in
Davila&mdash;for I&#8217;ve been with her a lot this
autumn&mdash;and then, at the pinch, were obliged to
take Elaine, also, because she was with her and
would give the alarm if left behind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A pretty fair scheme,&#8221; said Macloud. &#8220;The
fellow who is managing this business knew we would
do more for the women than for ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the same old difficulty&mdash;we haven&#8217;t got
Parmenter&#8217;s treasure, but they refuse to be convinced.&#8221;</p>
<p>The telephone rang, and Croyden himself
answered it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Carrington asks that we come over
at once,&#8221; he said, hanging up the receiver. &#8220;The
Pinkerton men have arrived.&#8221;</p>
<p>They finished their breakfast and started.
Half way to the gate, they met the postman coming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
up the walk. He handed Croyden a letter,
faced about and trudged away.</p>
<p>Croyden glanced at it, mechanically tore open
the envelope, and drew it out. As his eyes fell on
the first line, he stopped, abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to this!&#8221; he said.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<div class='ra'>
<p style=' margin-right:5em;'>&#8220;On Board The Parmenter,</p>
<p style=' margin-right:5em;'>&#8220;Pirate Sloop of War,</p>
<p style=' margin-right:2em;'>&#8220;Off the Capes of the Chesapeake.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Dear Sir:&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems something is required to persuade you
that we mean business. Therefore, we have abducted
Miss Carrington and her friend, Miss
Cavendish, in the hope that it will rouse you to a
proper realization of the eternal fitness of things,
and of our intention that there shall be a division
of the jewels&mdash;or their value in money. Our attorney
had the pleasure of an interview with you,
recently, at which time he specified a sum of two
hundred and fifty thousand dollars, as being sufficient.
A further investigation of the probable
value of the jewels, having convinced us that we
were in slight error as to their present worth, induces
us to reduce the amount, which we claim as
our share, to two hundred thousand dollars. This
is the minimum of our demand, however, and we
have taken the ladies, aforesaid, as security for its
prompt payment.</p>
<p>&#8220;They will be held in all comfort and respect (if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
no effort at rescue be attempted&mdash;otherwise we will
deal with them as we see fit), for the period of
ten days from the receipt of this letter, which will
be at noon to-morrow. If the sum indicated is not
paid, they will, at the expiration of the ten days, be
turned over to the tender mercies of the crew.&mdash;Understand?</p>
<p>&#8220;As to the manner of payment&mdash;You, yourself,
must go to Annapolis, and, between eleven and
twelve in the morning, proceed to the extreme edge
of Greenberry Point and remain standing, in full
view from the Bay, for the space of fifteen minutes.
You will, then, face about, step ten paces, and bury
the money, which must be in thousand dollar bills,
under a foot of sand. You will then, immediately,
return to Annapolis and take the first car to
Baltimore, and, thence, to Hampton.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the event that you have not reduced the jewels
to cash, we will be content with such a division as
will insure us a moiety thereof. It will be useless
to try deception concerning them,&mdash;though a few
thousand dollars, one way or the other, won&#8217;t matter.
When you have complied with these terms,
the young women will be released and permitted to
return to Hampton. If not&mdash;they will wish they
were dead, even before they are. We are, sir, with
deep respect,</p>
<div class='ra'>

<p>&#8220;Geoffrey Croyden, Esq&#8217;r.</p>
<p style=' margin-bottom:1.5em;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Hampton, Md.&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Where was it mailed?&#8221; Macloud asked.</p>
<p>Croyden turned over the envelope. It was postmarked
Hampton, 6.30 <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A.M.,</span> of that day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which implies that it was mailed some time
during the night,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you make of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean, will they carry out their threat?&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have been rather persistent,&#8221; Macloud replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s absurd!&#8221; Croyden exclaimed. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t
the jewels. Damn Parmenter and his infernal
letter!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Parmenter is not to blame,&#8221; said Macloud.
&#8220;Damn the thieves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And damn my carelessness in letting them pick
my pocket! there lies the entire difficulty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the thing, now, is to save the women&mdash;and
how?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pay, if need be!&#8221; exclaimed Croyden. &#8220;The
two hundred thousand I got for the Virginia Development
bonds will be just enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Macloud nodded. &#8220;I&#8217;m in for half, old man.
Aside from any personal feelings we may have
for the women in question,&#8221; he said, with a serious
sort of smile, &#8220;we owe it to them&mdash;they were abducted
solely because of us&mdash;to force us to disgorge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready to pay the cash at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be hasty!&#8221; Macloud cautioned. &#8220;We
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
have ten days, and the police can take a try at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>That</i>, for the police!&#8221; said Croyden, snapping
his fingers. &#8220;They&#8217;re all bunglers&mdash;they will be
sure to make a mess of it, and, then, no man can
foresee what will happen. It&#8217;s not right to subject
the women to the risk. Let us pay first, and punish
after&mdash;if we can catch the scoundrels. How long
do you think Henry Cavendish will hesitate when
he learns that Elaine has been abducted, and the
peril which menaces her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thunder! we have clean forgot her father!&#8221;
exclaimed Macloud. &#8220;He should be informed at
once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what he shouldn&#8217;t be,&#8221; Croyden returned.
&#8220;What is the good in alarming him? Free her&mdash;then
she may tell him, or not, as it pleases her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Macloud held out his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Done!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our first duty <i>is</i> to save
the women, the rest can bide until they are free.
How about the money? Are your stocks readily
convertible? If not, I&#8217;ll advance your share.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Much obliged, old man,&#8221; said Croyden, &#8220;but
a wire will do it&mdash;they&#8217;re all listed on New York.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you lose much, if you sell now?&#8221; asked
Macloud. He wished Croyden would let him pay
the entire amount.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just about even; a little to the good, in fact,&#8221;
was the answer.</p>
<p>And Macloud said no more&mdash;he knew it was
useless.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></p>
<p>At Ashburton, they found Captain Carrington
pacing the long hall, in deep distress&mdash;uncertain
what course to pursue, because there was no indication
as to what had caused the disappearance.
He turned, as the two men entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;The detectives are quizzing the servants in the
library,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t sit still.&mdash;You have
news?&#8221; he exclaimed, reading Croyden&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have!&#8221; said Croyden, and gave him the letter.</p>
<p>He seized it. As he read, concern, perplexity,
amazement, anger, all showed in his countenance.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have been abducted!&mdash;Davila and Miss
Cavendish, and are held for ransom!&mdash;a fabulous
ransom, which you are asked to pay,&#8221; he said,
incredulously. &#8220;So much, at least, is intelligible.
But why? why? Who are Robert Parmenter&#8217;s Successors?&mdash;and
who was he? and the jewels?&mdash;I
cannot understand&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not surprised,&#8221; said Croyden. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
long story&mdash;too long to tell&mdash;save that Parmenter
was a pirate, back in 1720, who buried a treasure
on Greenberry Point, across the Severn from Annapolis,
you know, and died, making Marmaduke
Duval his heir, under certain conditions. Marmaduke,
in turn, passed it on to his son, and so
on, until Colonel Duval bequeathed it to me. We
searched&mdash;Mr. Macloud and I&mdash;for three weeks,
but did not find it. Our secret was chanced upon
by two rogues, who, with their confederates, however,
are under the conviction we <i>did</i> find it. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
wanted a rake-off. I laughed at them&mdash;and this
abduction is the result.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why abduct the women?&#8221; asked the old man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because they think I can be coerced more
easily. They are under the impression that I am&mdash;fond
of Miss Carrington. At any rate, they know
I&#8217;m enough of a friend to pay, rather than subject
her to the hazard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pay! I can&#8217;t pay! My whole fortune isn&#8217;t
over twenty thousand dollars. It I will gladly
sacrifice, but more is impossible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not to pay, my old friend,&#8221; said Croyden.
&#8220;Mr. Macloud and I are the ones aimed
at and we will pay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t permit it, sir!&#8221; the Captain exclaimed.
&#8220;There is no reason for you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tut! tut!&#8221; said Croyden, &#8220;you forget that
we are wholly responsible; but for us, Miss Carrington
and Miss Cavendish would not have been
abducted. The obligation is ours, and we will discharge
it. It is our plain, our very plain, duty.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man threw up his hands in the extremity
of despair.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to do!&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know what to do!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do nothing&mdash;leave everything to us. We&#8217;ll
have Miss Carrington back in three days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And safe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And safe&mdash;if the letter is trustworthy, and I
think it is. The police can&#8217;t do as well&mdash;they may
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
fail entirely&mdash;and think of the possible consequences!
Miss Carrington and Miss Cavendish are
very handsome women.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My God, yes!&#8221; exclaimed the Captain.
&#8220;Anything but that! If they were men, or
children, it would be different&mdash;they could take
some chances. But women!&#8221;&mdash;He sank on a chair
and covered his face with his hands. &#8220;You must
let me pay what I am able,&#8221; he insisted. &#8220;All
that I have&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden let his hand fall sympathizingly on the
other&#8217;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;It shall be as you wish,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;We
will pay, and you can settle with us afterward&mdash;our
stocks can be converted instantly, you see,
while yours will likely require some time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Captain pulled himself together and arose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been sort of unmanned&mdash;I&#8217;m
better now. Shall you show the detectives
the letter&mdash;tell them we are going to pay
the amount demanded?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Croyden, uncertainly.
&#8220;What&#8217;s your opinion, Colin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let them see the letter,&#8221; Macloud answered,
&#8220;but on the distinct stipulation, that they make
no effort to apprehend &#8216;Robert Parmenter&#8217;s Successors&#8217;
until the women are safely returned. They
may pick up whatever clues they can obtain for
after use, but they must not do anything which
will arouse suspicion, even.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why take them into our confidence at all?&#8221;
asked Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;For two reasons: It&#8217;s acting square with them
(which, it seems to me, is always the wise thing to
do). And, if they are not let in on the facts, they
may blunder in and spoil everything. We want to
save the women at the earliest moment, without any
possible handicaps due to ignorance or inadvertence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But can we trust them?&#8221; Croyden asked,
doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the lesser of two evils.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will have to explain the letter, its reference
to the Parmenter jewels, and all that it contains.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see no objection. We didn&#8217;t find the
treasure, and, I reckon, they&#8217;re welcome to search,
if they think there is a chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, let it be exactly as you wish&mdash;you&#8217;re quite
as much concerned for success as I am,&#8221; said Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly, more so,&#8221; returned Macloud,
seriously.</p>
<p>And Croyden understood.</p>
<p>Then, they went into the library. The two
detectives arose at their entrance. The one, Rebbert,
was a Pinkerton man, the other, Sanders,
was from the Bureau at City Hall. Both were
small men, with clean shaven faces, steady, searching
eyes, and an especially quiet manner.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Croyden,&#8221; said Rebbert, &#8220;we have been
questioning the servants, but have obtained nothing
of importance, except that the ladies wore their
hats and coats (at least, they have disappeared).
This, with the fact that you found Miss Cavendish&#8217;s
glove and handkerchief, on a road without the
limits of Hampton, leads to the conclusion that
they have been abducted. But why? Miss Carrington,
we are informed, has no great wealth&mdash;how
as to Miss Cavendish?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She has more than sufficient&mdash;in fact, she is
very rich&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! then we <i>have</i> a motive,&#8221; said the detective.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a motive, but it is not Miss Cavendish,&#8221;
Croyden answered. &#8220;You&#8217;re correct as to the abduction,
however&mdash;this will explain,&#8221; and he handed
him the letter.</p>
<p>The two men read it.</p>
<p>&#8220;When did you receive this?&#8221; said one.</p>
<p>&#8220;At noon to-day,&#8221; replied Croyden, passing
over the envelope.</p>
<p>They looked carefully at the postmark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you object to explaining certain things in
this letter?&#8221; Rebbert asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in the least,&#8221; replied Croyden. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
tell you the entire story.... Is
there anything I have missed?&#8221; he ended.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well! Now, we prefer that you should
take no measures to apprehend the abductors, until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
after Miss Cavendish and Miss Carrington have been
released. We are going to pay the amount demanded.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to pay the two hundred thousand dollars!&#8221;
cried the detectives, in one breath.</p>
<p>Croyden nodded. &#8220;Afterward, you can get as
busy as you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>A knowing smile broke over the men&#8217;s faces, at
the same instant.</p>
<p>&#8220;You too think we found the treasure?&#8221; Croyden
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks that way, sir,&#8221; said Rebbert; while
Sanders acquiesced, with another smile.</p>
<p>Croyden turned to Macloud and held up his
hands, hopelessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we only had!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;If we only
had!&#8221;</p>

<h3>THE CHECK</h3>
</div>

<p>On the second morning after their abduction,
when Elaine and Davila arose, the sky was obscured
by fog, the trees exuded moisture, and only
a small portion of the Bay was faintly visible
through the mist.</p>
<p>&#8220;This looks natural!&#8221; said Elaine. &#8220;We must
have moved out to Northumberland, in the night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Davila smiled, a feeble sort of smile. It was not
a morning to promote light-heartedness, and particularly
under such circumstances.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this anything like Northumberland?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!&mdash;Only Northumberland is more so. For
a misty day, this would be remarkably fine.&mdash;With
us, it&#8217;s midnight at noon&mdash;all the lights burning,
in streets, and shops, and electric cars, bells jangling,
people rushing, pushing, diving through the
dirty blackness, like devils in hell. Oh, it&#8217;s pleasant,
when you get used to it.&mdash;Ever been there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Davila, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must have you out&mdash;say, immediately after
the holidays. Will you come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be glad to come, if I&#8217;m alive&mdash;and we
ever get out of this awful place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i> stupid here,&#8221; said Elaine. &#8220;I thought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
there was something novel in being abducted, but
it&#8217;s rather dreary business. I&#8217;m ready to quit, are
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was ready to quit before we started!&#8221; Davila
laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will see what can be done about it. We&#8217;ll
have in the head jailer.&#8221; She struck the bell. &#8220;Ask
the chief to be kind enough to come here a moment,&#8221;
she said, to the girl who attended them.</p>
<p>In a few minutes, he appeared&mdash;suave, polite,
courteous.</p>
<p>&#8220;You sent for me, Miss Cavendish?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did. Sit down, please, I&#8217;ve something to
say to you, Mr.&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jones, for short,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you!&#8221; said Elaine, with a particularly
winning smile. &#8220;Mr. Jones, for short&mdash;you will
pardon me, I know, if I seem unduly personal, but
these quarters are not entirely to our liking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very sorry, indeed,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;We
tried to make them comfortable. In what are they
unsatisfactory?&mdash;we will remedy it, if possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We would prefer another locality&mdash;Hampton,
to be specific.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean that you are tired of captivity?&#8221;
he smiled. &#8220;I see your point of view, and I&#8217;m
hopeful that Mr. Croyden will see it, also, and
permit us to release you, in a few days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is that very point I wish to discuss a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
moment with you,&#8221; she interrupted. &#8220;I told you
before, that Mr. Croyden didn&#8217;t find the jewels
and that, therefore, it is impossible for him to pay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will pardon me if I doubt your statement.&mdash;Moreover,
we are not privileged to discuss the
matter with you. We can deal only with Mr.
Croyden, as I think I have already intimated.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you will draw an empty covert,&#8221; she
replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;That remains to be seen, as I have also intimated,&#8221;
said Mr. Jones, easily.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t want to draw an empty covert,
do you&mdash;to have only your trouble for your
pains?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be a great disappointment, I assure
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have been at considerable expense to provide
for our entertainment?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pray do not mention it!&mdash;it&#8217;s a very great
pleasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be a greater pleasure to receive the
cash?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since the cash is our ultimate aim, I confess
it would be equally satisfactory,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why not tell me the amount?&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such matters are for Mr. Croyden,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just assume that Mr. Croyden cannot pay,&#8221;
she insisted. &#8220;Are <i>we</i> not to be given a chance to
find the cash?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Croyden can pay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But assume that he cannot,&#8221; she reiterated,
&#8220;or won&#8217;t&mdash;it&#8217;s the same result.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In that event, you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would be given the opportunity,&#8221; she broke
in.</p>
<p>He bowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why not let us consider the matter in the
first instance?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;The money is the
thing. It can make no difference to you whence
it comes&mdash;from Mr. Croyden or from me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None in the world!&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it would be much more simple to accept a
check and to release us when it is paid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Checks are not accepted in this business!&#8221; he
smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ordinarily not, it would be too dangerous, I
admit. But if it could be arranged to your satisfaction,
what then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it can be arranged,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;The amount is much too great.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that amount is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she persisted, smiling
at him the while.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two hundred thousand dollars,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;With what per cent. off for cash?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None&mdash;not a fraction of a penny!&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded, slightly. &#8220;Why can&#8217;t it be
arranged?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re thinking of paying it?&#8221; he asked, incredulously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I want to know why you think it can&#8217;t be
arranged?&#8221; she repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;The danger of detection. No bank would pay
a check for that amount to an unknown party, without
the personal advice of the drawer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if it were made payable to self, and
properly indorsed for identification?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can try it&mdash;there&#8217;s no harm in trying.
You have a bank that knows you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But scarcely for such large amounts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What of it? You deposit the check for collection
only. They will send it through. When
it&#8217;s paid, they will pay you. If it&#8217;s not paid, there
is no harm done&mdash;and we are still your prisoners.
You stand to win everything and lose nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man looked thoughtfully at the ceiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;The check will be paid?&#8221; he asked, presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it isn&#8217;t paid, you still have us,&#8221; said Elaine.</p>
<p>&#8220;It might be managed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is your part. If the check is presented,
it will be paid&mdash;you may rest easy, on that score.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jones resumed his contemplation of the ceiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;But remember,&#8221; she cautioned, &#8220;when it is
paid, we are to be released, instantly. No holding
us for Mr. Croyden to pay, also. If we play
square with you, you must play square with us.
I risk a fortune, see that you make good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your check&mdash;it should be one of the sort you
always use&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I always carry a few blank checks in my handbag&mdash;and
fortunately, I have it with me. You
were careful to wrap it in with my arms. I will
get it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She went into her room. In a moment she returned,
the blank check in her fingers, and handed
it to him. It was of a delicate robin&#8217;s-egg blue,
with &#8220;The Tuscarora Trust Company&#8221; printed
across the face in a darker shade, and her monogram,
in gold, at the upper end.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it sufficiently individual to raise a presumption
of regularity?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly!&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, let us understand each other,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;By all means,&#8221; he agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I give you my check for two hundred thousand
dollars, duly executed, payable to my order, and endorsed
by me, which, when paid, you, on behalf of
your associates and yourself, engage to accept in
lieu of the amount demanded from Mr. Croyden, and
to release Miss Carrington and myself forthwith.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is one thing more,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You,
on your part, are to stipulate that no attempt will
be made to arrest us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will engage that <i>we</i> will do nothing to
apprehend you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Directly or indirectly?&#8221; he questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!&mdash;more than that is not in our power.
You will have to assume the general risk you took
when you abducted us.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We will take it,&#8221; was the quiet answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there anything else?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not&mdash;at least, everything is entirely
satisfactory to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite the fact that it couldn&#8217;t be made so!&#8221;
she smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know we had to deal with a woman
of such business sense and&mdash;wealth,&#8221; he answered
gallantly.</p>
<p>She smiled. &#8220;If you will get me ink and pen,
I will sign the check,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She filled it in for the amount specified, signed
and endorsed it. Then she took, from her handbag,
a correspondence card, embossed with her
initials, and wrote this note:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<div class='ra'>
<p style=' margin-right:5em;'>&#8220;Hampton, Md.</p>
<p style=' margin-right:2em;'>&#8220;Nov. &mdash;&#8217;10.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;My dear Mr. Thompson:&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have made a purchase, down here, and my
check for Two Hundred Thousand dollars, in consideration,
will come through, at once. Please see
that it is paid, promptly.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style=' margin-right:10em;'>&#8220;Yours very sincerely,</p>
<p style=' margin-right:2em;'>&#8220;Elaine Cavendish.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;To James Thompson, Esq&#8217;r.,
&#8220;Treasurer, The Tuscarora Trust Co.,
&#8220;Northumberland.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>She addressed the envelope and passed it and the
card across to Mr. Jones, together with the check.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If you will mail this, to-night, it will provide
against any chance of non-payment,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a marvel of accuracy,&#8221; he answered,
with a bow. &#8220;I would I could always do business
with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At two hundred thousand the time? No! no!
monsieur, I pray thee, no more!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a knock on the door; the maid entered
and spoke in a low tone to Jones. He nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry to inconvenience you again,&#8221; he
said, turning to them, &#8220;but I must trouble you to
go aboard the tug.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The tug&mdash;on the water?&#8221; Elaine exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the water&mdash;that is usually the place for
well behaved tugs!&#8221; he laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now!&#8221; Elaine persisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now&mdash;before I go to deposit the check!&#8221; he
smiled. &#8220;You will be safer on the tug. There
will be no danger of an escape or a rescue&mdash;and
it won&#8217;t be for long, I trust.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your trust is no greater than ours, I assure
you,&#8221; said Elaine.</p>
<p>Their few things were quickly gathered, and they
went down to the wharf, where a small boat was
drawn up ready to take them to the tug, which was
lying a short distance out in the Bay.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the Baltimore tugs, likely,&#8221; said Davila.
&#8220;There are scores of them, there, and some are
none too chary about the sort of business they
are employed in.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Witness the present!&#8221; commented Elaine.</p>
<p>They got aboard without accident. Jones conducted
them to the little cabin, which they were to
occupy together&mdash;an upper and a lower bunk having
been provided.</p>
<p>&#8220;The maid will sleep in the galley,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;She will look after the cooking, and you will dine
in the small cabin next to this one. It&#8217;s a bit contracted
quarters for you, and I&#8217;m sorry, but it
won&#8217;t be for long&mdash;as we both trust, Miss
Cavendish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you?&#8221; asked Elaine.</p>
<p>&#8220;I go to deposit the check. I will have my bank
send it direct for collection, with instructions to
wire immediately if paid. I presume you don&#8217;t
wish it to go through the ordinary course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most assuredly not!&#8221; Elaine answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Thursday,&#8221; said Jones. &#8220;The check,
and your note, should reach the Trust Company
in the same mail to-morrow morning; they can
be depended upon to wire promptly, I presume?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, we may be able to release you to-morrow
night, certainly by Saturday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t come too soon for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem to like our hospitality,&#8221; Jones
observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s excellent of its sort, but we don&#8217;t fancy
the sort&mdash;you understand, monsieur. And then,
too, it is frightfully expensive.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We have done the best we could under the
circumstances,&#8221; he smiled. &#8220;Until Saturday at
the latest&mdash;meanwhile, permit me to offer you a
very hopeful farewell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elaine smiled sweetly, and Mr. Jones went out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you treat him so amiably?&#8221; Davila
asked. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t, if I would.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Policy,&#8221; Elaine answered. &#8220;We get on better.
It wouldn&#8217;t help our case to be sullen&mdash;and
it might make it much worse. I would gladly
shoot him, and hurrah over it, too, as I fancy you
would do, but it does no good to show it, now&mdash;when
we <i>can&#8217;t</i> shoot him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose not,&#8221; said Davila. &#8220;But I&#8217;m glad
I don&#8217;t have to play the part.&#8221; She hesitated a
moment. &#8220;Elaine, I don&#8217;t know how to thank you
for my freedom&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait until you have it!&#8221; the other laughed.
&#8220;Though there isn&#8217;t a doubt of the check being
paid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My grandfather, I know, will repay you with
his entire fortune, but that will be little&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Elaine stopped her further words by placing a
hand over her mouth, and kissing her.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s quite enough, dear!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Take
it that the reward is for my release, and that you
were just tossed in for good measure&mdash;or, that
it is a slight return for the pleasure of visiting
you&mdash;or, that the money is a small circumstance
to me&mdash;or, that it is a trifling sum to pay to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
saved the embarrassment of proposing to Geoffrey,
myself&mdash;or, take it any way you like, only, don&#8217;t
bother your pretty head an instant more about it.
In the slang of the day: &#8216;Forget it,&#8217; completely
and utterly, as a favor to me if for no other
reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll promise to forget it&mdash;until we&#8217;re free,&#8221;
agreed Davila.</p>
<p>&#8220;And, in the meantime, let us have a look around
this old boat,&#8221; said Elaine. &#8220;You&#8217;re nearer the
door, will you open it? Two can&#8217;t pass in this
room.&#8221;</p>
<p>Davila tried the door&mdash;it refused to open.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s locked!&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well! we will content ourselves with watching
the Bay through the port hole, and when one
wants to turn around the other can crawl up
in her bunk. I&#8217;m going to write a book about this
experience, some time.&mdash;I wonder what Geoffrey and
Colin are doing?&#8221; she laughed&mdash;&#8220;running around
like mad and stirring up the country, I reckon.&#8221;</p>

<h2>XXI</h2>
<h3>THE JEWELS</h3>
</div>

<p>Macloud went to New York on the evening
train. He carried Croyden&#8217;s power of attorney
with stock sufficient, when sold, to make up his
share of the cash. He had provided for his own
share by a wire to his brokers and his bank in
Northumberland. A draft would be awaiting him.
He would reduce both amounts to one thousand
dollar bills and hurry back to Annapolis to meet
Croyden.</p>
<p>But they counted not on the railroads,&mdash;or
rather they did count on them, and they were disappointed.
A freight was derailed just south of
Hampton, tearing up the track for a hundred yards,
and piling the right of way with wreckage of every
description. Macloud&#8217;s train was twelve hours late
leaving Hampton. Then, to add additional ill luck,
they ran into a wash out some fifty miles further
on; with the result that they did not reach
New York until after the markets were over and
the banks had closed for the day.</p>
<p>He wired the facts to Croyden. The following
day, he sold the stocks, the brokers gave him the
proceeds in the desired bills, after the delivery
hour, and he made a quick get-away for Annapolis,
arriving there at nine o&#8217;clock in the evening.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span></p>
<p>Croyden was awaiting him, at Carvel Hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, for the girls&#8217; sake,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but
it&#8217;s only a day lost. We will deliver the goods
to-morrow. And, then, pray God, they be freed
before another night! That lawyer thief is a
rogue and a robber, but something tells me he
will play straight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon we will have to trust him,&#8221; returned
Macloud. &#8220;Where is the Pinkerton man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is in town. He will be over on the Point
in the morning, disguised as a negro and chopping
wood, on the edge of the timber. There isn&#8217;t much
chance of him identifying the gang, but it&#8217;s the
best we can do. It&#8217;s the girls first, the scoundrels
afterward, if possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>At eleven o&#8217;clock the following day, Croyden,
mounted on one of &#8220;Cheney&#8217;s Best,&#8221; rode away from
the hotel. There had been a sudden change in the
weather, during the night; the morning was clear
and bright and warm, as happens, sometimes, in
Annapolis, in late November. The Severn, blue
and placid, flung up an occasional white cap to
greet him, as he crossed the bridge. He nodded to
the draw-keeper, who recognized him, drew aside
for an automobile to pass, and then trotted sedately
up the hill, and into the woods beyond.</p>
<p>He could hear the Band of the Academy pounding
out a quick-step, and catch a glimpse of the
long line of midshipmen passing in review, before
some notable. The &#8220;custard and cream&#8221; of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
chapel dome obtruded itself in all its hideousness;
the long reach of Bancroft Hall glowed white in
the sun; the library with its clock&mdash;the former,
by some peculiar idea, placed at the farthest point
from the dormitory, and the latter where the
midshipmen cannot see it&mdash;dominated the opposite
end of the grounds. Everywhere was quiet, peace,
and discipline&mdash;the embodiment of order and law,&mdash;the
Flag flying over all.</p>
<p>And yet, he was on his way to pay a ransom
of very considerable amount, for two women who
were held prisoners!</p>
<p>He tied his horse to a limb of a maple, and
walked out on the Point. Save for a few trees,
uprooted by the gales, it was the same Point they
had dug over a few weeks before. A negro, chopping
at a log, stopped his work, a moment, to
look at him curiously, then resumed his labor.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Pinkerton man!&#8221; thought Croyden, but
he made no effort to speak to him.</p>
<p>Somewhere,&mdash;from a window in the town, or from
one of the numerous ships bobbing about on the
Bay or the River&mdash;he did not doubt a glass was
trained on him, and his every motion was being
watched.</p>
<p>For full twenty minutes, he stood on the extreme
tip of the Point, and looked out to sea. Then he
faced directly around and stepped ten paces inland.
Kneeling, he quickly dug with a small trowel a hole
a foot deep in the sand, put into it the package
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
of bills, wrapped in oil-skin, and replaced the
ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; said he, as he arose. &#8220;Pirate&#8217;s gold
breeds pirate&#8217;s ways. May we have seen the last
of you&mdash;and may the devil take you all!&#8221;</p>
<p>He went slowly back to his horse, mounted, and
rode back to town. They had done their part&mdash;would
the thieves do theirs?</p>
<p>Adhering strictly to the instructions, Croyden
and Macloud left Annapolis on the next car,
caught the boat at Baltimore, and arrived in Hampton
in the evening, in time for dinner. They
stopped a few minutes at Ashburton, to acquaint
Captain Carrington with their return, and then
went on to Clarendon.</p>
<p>Both men were nervous. Neither wanted the
other to know and each endeavored to appear at
ease.</p>
<p>Croyden gave in first. He threw his cigarette
into his coffee cup, and pushed his chair back from
the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use, Colin!&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;You&#8217;re trying
to appear nonchalant, and you&#8217;re doing it very
well, too, but you can&#8217;t control your fingers and
your eyes&mdash;and neither can I, I fancy, though
I&#8217;ve tried hard enough, God knows! We are about
all in! These four days of strain and uncertainty
have taken it all out of us. If I had any doubt as
to my affection for Elaine, it&#8217;s vanished, now.&mdash;&mdash;I
don&#8217;t say I&#8217;m fool enough to propose to her,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
yet I&#8217;m scarcely responsible, at present. If I
were to see her this minute, I&#8217;d likely do something
rash.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re coming around to it, gradually,&#8221; said
Macloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gradually! Hum! I don&#8217;t know about the
&#8216;gradually.&#8217; I want to pull myself together&mdash;to
get a rein on myself&mdash;to&mdash;what are you smiling
at; am I funny?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are!&#8221; said Macloud. &#8220;I never saw a
man fight so hard against his personal inclinations,
and a rich wife. You don&#8217;t deserve her!&mdash;if I were
Elaine, I&#8217;d turn you down hard, hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God! you&#8217;re not Elaine!&#8221; Croyden retorted.</p>
<p>&#8220;And hence, with a woman&#8217;s unreasonableness
and trust in the one she loves, she will likely accept
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know she loves me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Macloud blew a couple of smoke rings and
watched them sail upward.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;re equally discerning as to Miss
Carrington, and her love for you,&#8221; Croyden commented.</p>
<p>&#8220;I regret to say, I&#8217;m not,&#8221; said Macloud,
seriously. &#8220;That is what troubles me, indeed.
Unlike my friend, Geoffrey Croyden, I&#8217;m perfectly
sure of my own mind, but I&#8217;m not sure of the
lady&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, why don&#8217;t you find out?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly what I shall do, when she returns.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s sure as fate!&#8221; said Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks! We each seem to be able to answer
the other&#8217;s uncertainty,&#8221; he remarked, calmly.</p>
<p>Presently, Macloud arose.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going over to Ashburton, and talk with
the Captain a little&mdash;sort of cheer him up. Come
along?&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on!&#8221; said he. &#8220;It&#8217;s a very good occupation
for you, sitting up to the old gent. I&#8217;ll
give you a chance by staying away, to-night.
Make a hit with grandpa, Colin, make a hit with
grandpa!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you make a hit with yourself&mdash;get rid of
your foolish theory, and come down to simple
facts,&#8221; Macloud retorted, and he went out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get rid of your foolish theory,&#8221; Croyden soliloquized.
&#8220;Well, maybe&mdash;but <i>is</i> it foolish, that&#8217;s
the question? I&#8217;m poor, once more&mdash;I&#8217;ve not
enough even for Elaine Cavendish&#8217;s husband&mdash;there&#8217;s
the rub! she won&#8217;t be Geoffrey Croyden&#8217;s
wife, it&#8217;s I who will be Elaine Cavendish&#8217;s husband.
&#8216;Elaine Cavendish <i>and her husband</i> dine
with us to-night!&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;Elaine Cavendish <i>and her husband</i>
were at the horse show!&#8217; &#8216;Elaine Cavendish
<i>and her husband</i> were here!&mdash;or there!&mdash;or thus
and so!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>He could not endure it. It would be too belittling,
too disparaging of self-respect.&mdash;Elaine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
Cavendish&#8217;s husband!&mdash;Elaine Cavendish&#8217;s husband!
Might he out-grow it&mdash;be known for himself? He
glanced up at the portrait of the gallant soldier
of a lost cause, with the high-bred face and noble
bearing.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were a brave man, Colonel Duval!&#8221; he
said. &#8220;What would you have done?&#8221;</p>
<p>He took out a cigar, lit it very deliberately, and
fell to thinking.... Presently, worn out by
fatigue and anxiety, he dozed....</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>And as he dozed, the street door opened softly,
a light step crossed the hall, and Elaine Cavendish
stood in the doorway.</p>
<p>She was clad in black velvet, trimmed in sable.
Her head was bare. A blue cloak was thrown,
with careless grace, about her gleaming shoulders.
One slender hand lifted the gown from before
her feet. She saw the sleeping man and paused,
and a smile of infinite tenderness passed across
her face.</p>
<p>A moment she hesitated, and at the thought,
a faint blush suffused her face. Then she glided
softly over, bent and kissed him on the lips.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes, and sprang up! Startled!
She was there, before him, the blush still on cheek
and brow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Elaine! sweetheart!&#8221; he cried. And, straightway
took her, unresisting, in his arms....
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me all about yourself,&#8221; he said, at last,
drawing her down into the chair and seating himself
on the arm. &#8220;Where is Miss Carrington&mdash;safe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Colin&#8217;s with her&mdash;I reckon she&#8217;s safe!&#8221; smiled
Elaine. &#8220;It won&#8217;t be his fault if she isn&#8217;t, I&#8217;m
sure.&mdash;I left them at Ashburton, and came over here
to&mdash;you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alone!&#8221; said Croyden, bending over her.</p>
<p>She nodded, eyes half downcast.</p>
<p>&#8220;You foolish girl!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go back at once&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed, joyously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet a little while!&#8221; and bent again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Geoffrey! you&#8217;re dreadful!&#8221; she exclaimed,
half smothered. &#8220;My hair, dear,&mdash;do be careful!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be good&mdash;if you will kiss me again!&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re not asleep,&#8221; she objected.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why I want it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you will promise&mdash;not to kiss me again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For half an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Honest?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Honest.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up at him tantalizingly, her red
lips parted, her bosom fluttering below.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s worth coming half way for, sweetheart&mdash;you
may,&#8221; she said.... </p>
<p>&#8220;Now, if you&#8217;re done with foolishness&mdash;for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
little while,&#8221; she said, gayly, &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you how
we managed to get free.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know why you were abducted?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes!&mdash;the Parmenter jewels. Davila told
me the story, and how you didn&#8217;t find them, though
our abductors think you did, and won&#8217;t believe
otherwise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You suffered no hurt?&#8221; he asked, sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;None&mdash;we were most courteously treated; and
they released us, as quickly as the check was paid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean, that I gave them my check for the
ransom money&mdash;you hadn&#8217;t the jewels, you couldn&#8217;t
comply with the demand. How do you suppose
we got free?&#8221; she questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;You paid the money?&#8221; he asked, again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly! I knew you couldn&#8217;t pay it, so I
did. Don&#8217;t let us think of it, dear!&mdash;It&#8217;s over,
and we have each other, now. What is money
compared to that?&#8221; Then suddenly she, woman-like,
went straight back to it. &#8220;How did
you think we managed to get free&mdash;escaped?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Yes&mdash;I never thought
of your paying the money.&#8221;</p>
<p>She regarded him critically.</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; she said, &#8220;you are deceiving me!&mdash;you
are&mdash;<i>you</i> paid the money, also!&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;What matters it?&#8221; he said joyfully. &#8220;What
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
matters anything now? Macloud and I <i>did</i> pay
the ransom to-day&mdash;but of what consequence is it;
whether you bought your freedom, or we bought it,
or both bought it? You and Davila are here,
again&mdash;that&#8217;s the only thing that matters!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right you are! Geoffrey, right you are!&#8221;
came Macloud&#8217;s voice from the hallway, and Davila
and he walked into the room.</p>
<p>Elaine, with a little shriek, sprang up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be bashful!&#8221; said Macloud. &#8220;Davila
and I were occupying similar positions at Ashburton,
a short time ago. Weren&#8217;t we, little
girl?&#8221; as he made a motion to put his arm around
her.</p>
<p>Davila eluded him&mdash;though the traitor red confirmed
his words&mdash;and sought Elaine&#8217;s side for
safety.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pleasure only deferred, my dear!&#8221; he
laughed. &#8220;By the way, Elaine, how did Croyden
happen to give in? He was shying off at your
wealth&mdash;said it would be giving hostages to fortune,
and all that rot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up, you beggar!&#8221; Croyden exclaimed.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to try to make good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Geoffrey,&#8221; said Elaine, &#8220;won&#8217;t you show us
the old pirate&#8217;s letter&mdash;we&#8217;re all interested in it,
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, I will!&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll show you the
letter, and where I found it, and anything else
you want to see. Nothing is locked, to-night.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span></p>
<p>They went over to the escritoire. Croyden opened
the secret drawer, and took out the letter.</p>
<p>&#8220;A Message from the Dead!&#8221; he said, solemnly,
and handed it to Elaine.</p>
<p>She carried it to the table, spread it out under
the lamp, and Davila and she studied it, carefully,
even as Croyden and Macloud had done&mdash;reading
the Duval endorsements over and over again.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me there is something queer about
these postscripts,&#8221; she said, at last; &#8220;something
is needed to make them clear. Is this the entire
letter?&mdash;didn&#8217;t you find anything else?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing!&#8221; said Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I look?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most assuredly, sweetheart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bit dark in this hole. Let me have a
match.&#8221;</p>
<p>She struck it, and peered back into the recess.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Here is something!&mdash;only
a corner visible.&#8221; She put in her hand. &#8220;It
has slipped down, back of the false partition. I&#8217;ll
get it, presently.&mdash;There!&#8221;</p>
<p>She drew out a tiny sheet of paper, and handed
it to Croyden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does that help?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>Croyden glanced at it; then gave a cry of
amazed surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;It does!&#8221; he said. &#8220;It does! It&#8217;s the key to
the mystery. Listen!&#8221;</p>
<p>The rest crowded around him while he read:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span></p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<div class='ra'>
<p style=' margin-right:4em;'>&#8220;Hampton, Maryland.</p>
<p style=' margin-right:2em;'>&#8220;5 Oct. 1738.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Memorandum to accompany the letter of
Robert Parmenter, dated 10 May 1738.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whereas, it is stipulated by the said Parmenter
that the Jewels shall be used only in the Extremity
of Need; and hence, as I have an abundance of
this world&#8217;s Goods, that Need will, likely, not come
to me. And judging that Greenberry Point will
change, in time&mdash;so that my son or his Descendants,
if occasion arise, may be unable to locate
the Treasure&mdash;I have lifted the Iron box, from the
place where Parmenter buried it, and have reinterred
it in the cellar of my House in Hampton,
renewing the Injunction which Parmenter put upon
it, that it shall be used only in the Extremity of
Need. When this Need arise, it will be found in
the south-east corner of the front cellar. At the
depth of two feet, between two large stones, is the
Iron box. It contains the jewels, the most marvelous
I have ever seen.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style=' margin-right:2em;'>&#8220;Marmaduke Duval.&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>For a moment, they stood staring at one another
too astonished to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;My Lord!&#8221; Macloud finally ejaculated. &#8220;To
think that it was here, all the time!&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden caught up the lamp.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span></p>
<p>They trooped down to the cellar, Croyden leading
the way. Moses was off for the evening, they
had the house to themselves. As they passed the
foot of the stairs, Macloud picked up a mattock.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me for the digging!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Which is
the south-east corner, Davila?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There, under those boxes!&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>They were quickly tossed aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ground is not especially hard,&#8221; observed
Macloud, with the first stroke. &#8220;I reckon a yard
square is sufficient.&mdash;At a depth of two feet the
memorandum says, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>No one answered. Fascinated, they were watching
the fall of the pick. With every blow, they
were listening for it to strike the stones.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better get a shovel, Croyden, we&#8217;ll need it,&#8221;
said Macloud, pausing long enough, to throw off
his coat.... &#8220;Oh! I forgot to say, I
wired the Pinkerton man to recover the package
you buried this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Croyden only nodded&mdash;stood the lamp on a box,
and returned with the coal scoop.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will answer, I reckon,&#8221; he said, and fell
to work.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems absurd!&#8221; remarked Macloud, between
strokes. &#8220;To have hunted the treasure, for weeks,
all over Greenberry Point, and then to find it in
the cellar, like a can of lard or a bushel of
potatoes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t found it, yet,&#8221; Croyden cautioned.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
&#8220;And we&#8217;ve gone the depth mentioned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No! we haven&#8217;t found it, yet!&mdash;but we&#8217;re going
to find it!&#8221; Macloud answered, sinking the pick,
viciously, in the ground, with the last word.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>It had struck hard against a stone.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did I tell you?&#8221; Macloud cried, sinking
the pick in at another place.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>Again, it struck! and again! and again! The
fifth stroke laid the stone bare&mdash;the sixth and
seventh loosened it, still more&mdash;the eighth and ninth
completed the task.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me the shovel!&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>When the earth was away and the stone exposed,
he stooped and, putting his fingers under the edges,
heaved it out.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rest is for you, Croyden!&#8221; and stepped
aside.</p>
<p>The iron box was found!</p>
<p>For a moment, Croyden looked at it, rather
dazedly. Could it be the jewels were <i>there</i>!&mdash;within
his reach!&mdash;under that lid! Suddenly, he
laughed!&mdash;gladly, gleefully, as a boy&mdash;and sprang
down into the hole.</p>
<p>The box clung to its resting place for a second,
as though it was reluctant to be disturbed&mdash;then it
yielded, and Croyden swung it onto the bank.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll take it to the library,&#8221; he said, scraping
it clean of the adhering earth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span></p>
<p>And carrying it before them, like the Ark of
the Covenant, they went joyously up to the floor
above.</p>
<p>He placed it on the table under the chandelier,
where all could see. It was of iron, rusty with age;
in dimension, about a foot square; and fastened
by a hasp, with the bar of the lock thrust through
but not secured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Light the gas, Colin!&mdash;every burner,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll have the full effulgence, if you please.&#8221;...</p>
<p>For a little time, the lid resisted. Suddenly, it
yielded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Behold!&#8221; he heralded, and flung it back.</p>
<p>The scintillations which leaped out to meet them,
were like the rays from myriads of gleaming,
glistening, varicolored lights, of dazzling brightness
and infinite depth. A wonderful cavern of
coruscating splendor&mdash;rubies and diamonds, emeralds
and sapphires, pearls and opals glowing with
all the fire of self, and the resentment of long
neglect.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heaven! What beauty!&#8221; exclaimed Davila.</p>
<p>It broke the spell.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are real!&#8221; Croyden laughed. &#8220;You may
touch them&mdash;they will not fade.&#8221;</p>
<p>They put them out on the table&mdash;in little heaps of
color. The women exclaiming whene&#8217;er they
touched them, cooingly as a woman does when
handling jewels&mdash;fondling them, caressing them,
loving them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span></p>
<p>At last, the box was empty. They stood back
and gazed&mdash;fascinated by it all:&mdash;the color&mdash;the
glowing reds and whites, and greens and blues.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is wonderful! wonderful!&#8221; breathed Elaine.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is wonderful&mdash;and it&#8217;s true!&#8221; said Croyden.</p>
<p>Two necklaces lay among the rubies, alike as
lapidary&#8217;s art could make them. Croyden handed
one to Macloud, the other he took.</p>
<p>&#8220;In remembrance of your release, and of Parmenter&#8217;s
treasure!&#8221; he said, and clasped it around
Elaine&#8217;s fair neck.</p>
<p>Macloud clasped his around Davila&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who cares, now, for the time spent on Greenberry
Point or the double reward!&#8221; he laughed.</p>
